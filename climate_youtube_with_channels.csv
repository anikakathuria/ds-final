ih88GVHyDZY,Who suffers in Cape Town’s water crisis? | Featured Documentary | Capturing Water,"After three years of poor rainfall, in 2018, Cape Town announced drastic action to avoid running out of water completely. In this film, three activists fight for ""water justice"" and expose the socioeconomic divide and the environmental ""cracks"" in South Africa's water management system. In Cape Town’s ""Day Zero"" water crisis in 2018, Faeza Meyer fought against water cut-offs affecting poor communities, Caroline Marx tackled sewage pollution in a local lagoon, and Nazeer Sonday defended precious groundwater from industrial developers. The film examines how market-driven water management increases the rich-poor divide and contributes to broader environmental issues in South Africa. It exposes the systemic problems behind the 2018 crisis – and the complex relationship between economic policies and access to this vital resource. It emphasises the need for sustainable solutions to growing environmental problems – and is a reminder of the importance of water management and conservation at a time of increasing climate uncertainty.

g8NShKo3CSg,Native Climate Action | @Radar | Noticias Telemundo,"Video oficial de Noticias Telemundo. One of the largest climate action summits, COP26, takes place during Native American Heritage month here in the US—a fitting time junction considering Native Americans, and indigenous peoples worldwide, are the least likely to contribute to climate change yet stand to be among the most directly impacted.

The close relationship native communities have to the environment is counterpart to their reliance of its natural resources, resources that are becoming scarce due to global inaction. And while world leaders endlessly debate which egregious practices to cut back on, native communities are taking more progressive actions via climate action plans rooted in sustainable environmental practices passed down from their ancestors over centuries.

These communities have long acknowledged that our actions in addressing natural or man-made environmental crises will have a lasting impact on future generations, and that we have a responsibility to be accountable for that impact. And given the EPA’s recent findings that US indigenous, Black and Latinx communities are bearing the brunt of the negative environmental devastation, their sense of urgency warranted.

While the Biden administration establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity—the first federal program focused specifically on how greenhouse gas emissions affect human health—is a step forward, taking a note from the commitment and strategic action of indigenous communities could offer some much-needed assistance in our pursuit of a more sustainable environment and populace for years to come.

All in all, when it comes to confronting climate change, the United States—and the world—can learn a lot from indigenous communities.

ZVTpsOorJ_s,How can we adapt to the climate crisis?,"Here’s the hard truth: we are living through a climate crisis. We must halve greenhouse gas emissions to avoid a catastrophe. But there’s another part to this puzzle. We need to both lower emissions and adapt to climate change. This means better preparing for rising temperatures, floods, drought, wildfires and other calamities - the impacts of which are felt the hardest by the most vulnerable people in the world. This second part - adaptation - doesn’t always get the attention it deserves. But, along with mitigation, it is our key to becoming resilient. So how can we adapt to climate change? There are three components to adaptation: planning, finance and implementation.

PLANNING
On planning, there is progress. More than 80% of countries have put in place adaptation plans and targets - and many of these take into account the needs of those living in poverty and indigenous people.

FINANCE 
On finance, we need to do much more. Developing countries alone need about 70 billion dollars per year to adapt to the climate crisis. But only a fraction of that is available. The adaptation finance gap is widening. We need to scale up both public and private-sector funds to close this gap.

IMPLEMENTATION
We have been implementing more solutions to help us adapt. 
These include ‘Nature-based solutions’ that draw on the natural world to build climate defenses. For example, restoring mangrove forests can prevent erosion and create a natural defense from storms, cyclones, and coastal floods. And investing in early warning systems, through weather stations and communication networks, allows communities to prepare in advance for natural disasters by stockpiling resources or evacuating to safety.
As climate impacts accelerate, we need to step up our implementation.

There’s a lot we can do to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis. This is a race to build resilience. It’s a race we can win but only if we start today.

UNEP’s A""daptation Gap Report 2022: Too Little, Too Slow – Climate adaptation failure puts world at risk"" looks at progress in planning, financing and implementing adaptation actions as well as adaptation effectiveness and adaptation-mitigation linkages and co-benefits.

6bHDEK_Uo9U,Cooling Without AC? Is It Possible? #sustainablecooling #heatwavewarning,"How ACs are Worsening Temperatures in Delhi🥵

💨Air conditioners work by expelling hot air from indoors to the outside, contributing to the heating of the outdoor environment in densely populated cities like Delhi. Experts suggest ACs can add about 2°C of additional heat to the surroundings.
💨Widespread AC usage leads to a surge in electricity demand, often met by burning more fossil fuels. This increases greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and further intensifying heatwaves in the long run.
💨Overload of AC usage during peak heat periods strains the power infrastructure.
 💨Increased outdoor heat leads to more AC usage, which in turn releases more heat and increases energy demand, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates the urban heat island effect and climate change.
💨When ACs become less effective during extreme heat, residents might use them even more intensely or for longer durations, further increasing waste heat and energy consumption without achieving the desired cooling.
💨The heat expelled by ACs contributes to higher nighttime temperatures in urban areas, preventing the city from cooling down and increasing discomfort and health risks.

With the Trump administration fully in control of the U.S., it appears that the tides are changing in the climate change discussion. The White House has already withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, Trump wants to end what he’s calling “the green new scam,” and corporations around the world are abandoning their carbon neutrality pledges. How will this affect the climate change situation? Let’s take a look.

President Trump has issued an executive order targeting state and local climate policies designed to reduce carbon emissions and hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their role in global warming. Calling these regulations ""burdensome"" and ""unconstitutional,"" the order aims to block lawsuits brought by states and cities against big oil. Critics have condemned the move as an ""illegal"" attempt to dismantle local climate efforts, while Trump touts it as part of his broader push to ""unleash American energy"".

DtqSIplGXOA,New York City's greenhouse gas emissions as one-ton spheres of carbon dioxide gas,"In 2010 New York City added 54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (equivalent) to the atmosphere, but that number means little to most people because few of us have a sense of scale for atmospheric pollution. 

https://www.realworldvisuals.com/cv-projects/new-yorks-carbon-emissions

Carbon Visuals (precursor to Real World Visuals http://www.realworldvisuals.com) and Environmental Defense Fund (http://www.edf.org/climate/remaking-energy) wanted to make those emissions feel a bit more real - the total emissions and the rate of emission. Designed to engage the 'person on the street', this version is exploratory and still work in progress. Mayor Bloomberg's office has not been involved in the creation or dissemination of this video.

NYC carbon footprint:

54,349,650 tons a year = 148,903 tons a day = 6,204 tons an hour = 1.72 tons a second

At standard pressure and 59 °F a metric ton of carbon dioxide gas would fill a sphere 33 feet across (density of CO₂ = 1.87 kg/m³: http://bit.ly/CO2_datasheet). If this is how New York's emissions actually emerged we would see one of these spheres emerge every 0.58 seconds.

Emissions in 2010 were 12% less than 2005 emissions. The City of New York is on track to reduce emissions by 30% by 2017 - an ambitious target.

In a film to be released in cinemas and Netflix later this year he warns that “human beings have overrun the world”.

In David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet, the 93-year-old broadcaster says, “This film is my witness statement and my vision for the future – the story of how we came to make this our greatest mistake and how if we act now, we can yet put it right.”  In this interview with Andrew Marr he calls for an end to waste.

Jennifer Kay, University of Colorado at Boulder
Physics Colloquium 2021-01-21

Understanding the influence of clouds on global warming remains an important unsolved research problem. Cloud feedbacks are often found to be the largest uncertainty in global warming projections from climate models. This talk presents an overview of this topic, with a focus on recent observations, theory, and modeling results. After a general introduction, experiments that disable cloud radiative feedbacks or “lock the clouds” within a state‐of‐the‐art and well‐documented climate model will be presented. Through comparison of idealized greenhouse warming experiments with and without cloud locking, the sign and magnitude cloud feedbacks can be quantified. Global cloud feedbacks increase both global and Arctic warming by around 25%. In contrast, disabling Arctic cloud feedbacks has a negligible influence on both Arctic and global surface warming. Do observations and theory support a positive global cloud feedback and a weak Arctic cloud feedback? What are the implications especially for greater-than-global Arctic warming?",2021-01-22T14:22:44Z,UCVRy29tW8aPN_lE-B0yC4Aw,UT Physics Colloquium,[],2398,31,7,PT40M42S,24,none,1650,173,126206

Crash Course Geography #14,"Today we’re going to talk about climate change which is when there is a change in the average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time - these changes can be natural or human-caused. We’ll discuss the main driving forces of climate change in the past and show you how what’s happening now is unlike anything in the past. Global warming, or when there is an increase in the average surface temperature of the planet, has been well-documented since the Industrial Revolution, and scientists have concluded that there is a 95% probability that human activities like burning fossil fuels, industrialization, modern agriculture, and deforestation have caused most of this most recent warming. And while individual actions do matter in helping to curb the disastrous implications of a warming planet, it’s also up to us to hold corporations and governments responsible for the policies and the large-scale emissions that play a disproportionate role in impacting our atmosphere and climate.

IIdQup0RTrQ,Four shocking facts about the climate crisis. Which fact shocked you the most? 😱,"Every year, the United Nations holds a global climate change conference known as a COP which stands for ‘Conference of the Parties’. 

This year marks the 26th anniversary, giving it the name COP26 with the UK as its president.

Among the largest international meetings in the world, the summit is regarded by many to be the world’s last best chance to get runaway climate change under control.

It is seen as a critical opportunity to win more ambitious country-to-country commitments on achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and keeping the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius this century.

Ahead of the conference at the end of October the Evening Standard teamed up with Lottie Dodwell, Senior Interpretation Developer at the Natural History Museum, to bring you some shocking facts about the climate crisis.

Joe Biden made the climate crisis a priority for the Biden administration. 

This week, President Joe Biden signed executive orders in an effort to focus on the environment and turn around the economy. Biden also reversed Donald Trump's trans military ban, signaling a win for the LGBTQ+ community. Articles of impeachment were handed over to the Senate, formally kicking off a second trial against former President Donald Trump. New strains of the coronavirus are worrying scientists and medical experts about the effectiveness of current vaccines. And, a snowy owl was spotted in a once-in-a-lifetime New York experience.

ma-16mYsilA,The Big Problem With Carbon Offsets,"Imagine a financial tool that lowers greenhouse gasses, speeds the green transition and rejuvenates forests. That’s the promise of carbon offsets, but far from the reality. In this segment from Getting Warmer, Kal Penn explains how carbon offset markets work, or in most cases don’t.

---
Getting Warmer is Bloomberg's exclusive new show about climate, clean energy and business, anchored by actor and former White House aide Kal Penn.

Accompany him on his journey as he takes an up-close look at bold climate solutions and discovers new facets of the global transition to clean energy.

In a hosted studio segment, Penn sifts through the overwhelming news about our climate and breaks down the facts and trends to understand with a dose of humor and optimism. Why are the recycling symbols on your plastic cups misleading? How does the carbon credit market work and does it actually help? And what is the future of water in a drought-ridden world?

On the road, Penn meets the innovators, researchers, communities and businesses pivoting to new energy sources and spearheading low-carbon technologies. In documentary segments, Penn speaks to the self-declared “crypto cowboys” of Texas who claim Bitcoin mining can help stabilize the state’s troubled electrical grid, and travels to Nevada to visit the company attempting to build America’s first closed-loop supply chain for electric vehicles. In New York, Penn explores the urban designs proposed to save the city from the next Superstorm Sandy and goes inside New York’s Empire State building to investigate the challenges of decarbonizing our cities and landmarks. 

The show builds on, and includes contributions from, Bloomberg Green’s award-winning team of climate journalists as well as London-based climate storytellers Jack Harries and Alice Aedy. With a focus on the most pressing questions for young viewers, Jack and Alice unpack one big idea each episode. From recycled wastewater to regenerative agriculture and the challenges of a just transition for workers in the energy sector, they’ll break down how countries across the world are finding intriguing solutions to our climate crisis, and outline the challenges ahead.

Watch Getting Warmer starting February 1st at 8p EST streaming on Bloomberg channels on Connected TV Devices including Samsung TV+, LG Channels, and Fire TV. And on & Bloomberg.com.

You can also watch on Bloomberg TV (BTV)  at 10p ET.

There's a game of Tetris happening on a global scale: The playing space is planet Earth, and all those pesky, stacking blocks represent carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas that is piling up ever more rapidly as we burn the fossil fuels that run our cars, factories and power plants. Joss Fong outlines how this overload of CO2 leads to climate change and reminds us that, unlike Tetris, we won't get an opportunity to start over and try again.

tuyyRnsd9f0,How Concrete Waste Could Help Transform the Climate Crisis,"In a world where concrete forms a significant part of construction waste, Silicate, an XPRIZE Carbon Removal team hailing from Ireland, is turning the tables by using this plentiful resource to tackle the climate crisis.

They've developed a proprietary blend of materials, including recycled concrete, that absorbs CO2 from the air and adjusts soil pH balance to boost agricultural productivity. Through their work, construction debris is no longer just waste; it becomes useful to both the environment and farmers.

Join us as we explore the details of this transformative approach, delve into the realm of carbon sequestration, and uncover how it augments sustainable agriculture in this short documentary, ""Ballet of the Spreaders.""

XPRIZE has launched its XPRIZE Carbon Removal indie film showcase – a series of short films following XPRIZE Carbon Removal teams and their efforts to pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and oceans and sequester it durably and sustainably. 

Every week, we’ll host exclusive Discord watch parties for those in our community to see the films before they premiere on the XPRIZE YouTube channel the following day.

Be sure to join the conversation on Discord at discord.gg/xprize and get ready to learn more about the impact these teams are making. 

These videos were produced by independent film-makers through Glimmer to showcase the diversity of teams and solutions in the competition. This series does not serve as an endorsement of any specific team or their XPRIZE entry.

TXYr9jhRqK8,"Climate Crisis, and Why We Should Panic voiced by Keira Knightley | Extinction Rebellion","Extinction Rebellion has relaunched a short animated film entitled Climate Crisis, and Why We Should Panic. Written, directed and animated by Miritte Ben Yitzchak and voiced by British actress Keira Knightley, it urges us all to Act Now before it is too late.

The animated short Climate Crisis, and Why We Should Panic, is the second of a two-part explainer video series for Extinction Rebellion, focusing on the climate and ecological crisis. Voiced by Keira Knightley, it explains what’s causing climate change, why governments must enter crisis mode to tackle this issue, and what will happen if we don’t do something about it now. 

It follows the first part - Extinction Emergency, and Why We Must Act Now - which focuses on the ecological crisis. Voiced by Naomie Harris and scored by Brian Eno, it summarises the planet’s biodiversity loss, runaway consumerism and the ecological crisis that now faces us, and how the consequences will affect millions of lives around the world.

The drop in demand for power has been due mainly to the decreased use of coal-fired generators, but it was the sudden nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in March that finally pushed the numbers into negative territory.

Introduction:
Global warming is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It is a complex phenomenon driven by various interconnected factors. In this project, we aim to create a comprehensive model that explains the key components contributing to global warming. Our model will cover the following topics: 

1. Greenhouse Effect:
   The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), trap heat from the sun. This trapped heat leads to a gradual increase in global temperatures, resulting in global warming.

2. Air Pollution:
   Air pollution, caused by the release of pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from industrial processes and transportation, contributes to global warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect. These pollutants can interact with sunlight and atmospheric components, creating secondary greenhouse gases.

3. Deforestation:
   Deforestation involves the removal of forests, which act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down or burned, the stored carbon is released, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and contributing to global warming.

4. Pollution Due to Chemical Fertilizers:
   Agricultural practices involving the use of chemical fertilizers release nitrous oxide (N2O), another potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. This exacerbates the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming.

5. Natural Disaster - Flood:
   Climate change, driven by global warming, leads to more intense and frequent weather events, including floods. Rising temperatures can cause ice melt, increase precipitation, and alter weather patterns, increasing the likelihood of devastating floods.

6. Natural Disaster - Drought:
   Global warming can also result in prolonged and severe droughts due to altered rainfall patterns and increased evaporation. This disrupts ecosystems, threatens water resources, and impacts agriculture and food security.

Project Explanation:
Our model will provide a holistic understanding of how these interconnected factors contribute to global warming. It will include data analysis, visual representations, and simulations to illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships among these topics. Additionally, we will explore potential mitigation strategies and the importance of global cooperation to address this urgent environmental issue.

By studying and raising awareness of these components, we aim to foster a better understanding of global warming and inspire action to reduce its impact. Through education and informed decision-making, we can work towards a more sustainable future and mitigate the adverse effects of global warming on our planet.

i4vhMgG40IY,Washing away carbon emissions in the laundry | Roger Berry | TEDxBoston,"Humans have invented millions of chemicals that do many useful jobs. However, the intended beneficial properties can come at a cost to human and planetary health. Learn how implementing a nature-inspired chemical invention called TAML has the potential to save 85 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions and 26 billion gallons of water by changing the way we conduct an everyday task – laundry. TAML catalysts mimic nature’s processes to transform how we use chemicals, dramatically reduce carbon emissions, save precious water resources, and reduce the overall volume of chemicals in use today. Deploying TAML chemistry across multiple industry could save more than 1% of global carbon emissions and can have a radical impact on our planet. At the same time, the resource efficiency and potential cost savings for industry can align incentives to help the solution scale.  Roger Berry is the CEO of Sudoc, LLC, a company with a patented, nature-inspired chemistry that makes chemical reactions exponentially more powerful. With more than two decades of experience with investing in and leading companies with a focus on sustainability has prepared Roger for his current role in building a transformative sustainable chemistry company in Sudoc.

mz3pt4vSY54,Traditional farmland irrigation tools,"I. Precautions during the Irrigation Process
 
1. Equipment Inspection and Maintenance
 
- Regularly check the integrity of the paddle blades (or vanes). Ensure that the blades are free from damage and deformation, and that the connections (such as the rotating shaft and connecting rods) are firm. Avoid a decrease in water-lifting efficiency or equipment damage caused by loose components.
 
- Remove debris (such as weeds and stones) from the irrigation canals and equipment to prevent blockages in the gaps between the blades or jams in the transmission structure, which may affect the water flow.
 
2. Water Level and Volume Control
 
- Ensure that the water level in the lower irrigation canal is sufficient to meet the water-lifting requirements. Avoid the blades idling due to too low a water level (inability to scoop water effectively), or an increase in the equipment load due to excessive water volume.
 
- Adjust the water-lifting frequency and volume according to the elevation of the farmland and the soil moisture. Avoid soil compaction or root rot caused by waterlogging due to over-irrigation, or drought caused by insufficient irrigation.
 
3. Coordination of Human Operation
 
- If it is human-powered (such as pedal-operated or hand-cranked equipment), maintain a uniform operation rhythm. Avoid equipment damage or waste of manpower caused by excessive force or uncoordinated operation.
 
- When multiple people collaborate, clarify the division of labor to ensure the smooth operation of the transmission system (such as chains and gears) and reduce component wear.
 
4. Terrain Adaptation and Equipment Fixation
 
- Adjust the installation angle of the equipment according to the slope between the irrigation canal and the farmland to ensure that the blades are immersed in water at an appropriate depth (too shallow will result in insufficient water scooping, and too deep will increase resistance).
 
- Fix the base of the equipment to prevent the equipment from tilting or shifting due to long-term vibration or water flow impact, which may affect the stability of water lifting.
 
5. Water Quality and Soil Protection
 
- Avoid pumping water from polluted sources or sources with a large amount of sediment to prevent sediment deposition in the farmland from affecting the soil structure or blocking the gaps between the blades.
 
- Try to distribute the water flow evenly during irrigation to avoid soil erosion caused by local scouring. Especially in farmlands with a large slope, control the water flow speed.
 
II. Advantages of Traditional Water-lifting Irrigation Methods
 
1. Environmental Protection, Energy Conservation, and Dependence on Natural Forces
 
- There is no need for electricity or fuel. It mainly relies on human power, animal power, or water power (such as the waterwheel driven by the impact of water flow), with almost no carbon emissions. It is environmentally friendly and suitable for ecological agriculture and remote areas.
 
2. Simple Structure and Low Maintenance Cost
 
- Most of the equipment is made of natural materials such as wood and bamboo. The construction principle is intuitive (such as chain drive and blade water scooping), and it is easy to repair. There is no need for complex technology or professional tools, and the long-term use cost is low.
 
3. Flexible Adaptation to Small-scale Farmland
 
- It is suitable for scattered small plots of farmland or areas with complex terrain (such as terraced fields). The size and installation location of the equipment can be adjusted according to actual needs, which is more flexible than mechanized irrigation.
 
4. Promoting the Sustainability of the Water Conservancy System
 
- Through manual water lifting, the local water volume can be accurately controlled, reducing water resource waste. Especially in areas with water shortages, it can improve irrigation efficiency and achieve ""water supply on demand"".
 
5. Cultural and Technological Inheritance Value
 
- As an important achievement of traditional farming civilization (such as the ancient Chinese dragon-bone waterwheels and), it carries the wisdom of adapting to local conditions. Protecting and using such technologies helps to inherit agricultural cultural heritage and enhance the understanding of traditional farming technologies.
 
6. Reducing Soil and Ecological Damage
 
- It avoids the risks of soil compaction or chemical pollution that may be brought by mechanized irrigation. The pure physical water-lifting method is more coordinated with the natural water cycle, which is conducive to maintaining the balance of the farmland ecosystem.",2025-04-24T08:09:34Z,UCDB9Astmna7ZEk51hWaIRKg,outstanding laborers,[],8899,23,0,PT5S,22,none,159000,53,224710300

Can communities that want to get involved affect change in the complex world of climate policy? This talk addresses one potential way in which you can actively make a difference on a community level and translate that seamlessly on to a global scale. We discuss the power of money and collective action in changing minds, and how you can at an individual level be empowered to change the landscape of global climate policy. Darya Guettler is a Junior in Mechanical Engineering and Political Science. Her research interests revolve around climate change mitigation and renewable energy technologies. She is a member of the MIT Symphony Orchestra, the MIT Climate Action Team and the MIT Energy Club, and has spent her last summer interning at Tesla Energy. She hopes to work at the intersection of policy and technology for climate change in the future.

Meanwhile - people on the ground are already facing the grave consequences of extreme weather.
Globally, Indonesia is one of the largest producers and exporters. And it's the 8th biggest carbon emitter on the planet. Indonesia is now targeting to be carbon neutral by 2060 and stop building coal-fired plants in a few years. But despite that pledge: a facility in the city of Chilegone is undergoing a massive expansion. And those living in the area - fear the plant will further worsen water and air pollution.

Over the course of 2024, global temperatures hit record highs, yet again. Climate scientists are beginning to worry that temperatures are increasing faster than their models led them to expect. A paper that recently appeared said that the reason for the rapid warming is a reduction in certain types of clouds. If this is correct, and if that’s a trend, it’s very bad news. Welcome to 2025.

ZAQGoXIkTlw,Climate change: Carbon dioxide rises more than ever in 2024 | BBC News,"Levels of the most significant planet-warming gas in our atmosphere rose more quickly than ever previously recorded last year, scientists have said.
 
Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are now more than 50% higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels.
 
Last year, fossil fuel emissions were at record highs, while the natural world struggled to absorb as much CO2 due to factors including wildfires and drought, so more accumulated in the atmosphere.
 
The rapid increase in CO2 is ""incompatible"" with the international pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Met Office said.

CmdqtS71pRA,Greta Thunberg Passionate Speech at UN Climate Action Summit 2019,"Greta Thunberg has spoken at the United Nation's big New York climate summit and boy did she let world leaders have it!

In a super passionate speech, she told them she is worried about the future of the planet and challenged them to do more to help.
 
About 60 leaders from countries including Germany and New Zealand came to New York for the Climate Action Summit.

They talked about their country's plans to cut carbon emissions.

But a group of young people including Greta were also invited to present their views on climate change.

They want to inspire leaders to take more urgent action and while many countries have promised to do more, some people, like Greta, are worried that promises alone aren't enough to turn back the clock on climate change.

SCIENTISTS RECKON VENUS MAY HAVE ONCE BEEN HABITABLE
NASA scientists reckon Venus, the hottest planet in our solar system, was once a lot cooler and a bit more earth like!

Venus is known as our sister planet because it's a similar size and mass to Earth but it's WAY hotter, like 462 degrees hotter, and there's no liquid water.
 
NASA scientists have known for a while now that Venus used to have heaps of water covering its surface, kind of like a shallow ocean, but all that water turned to gas about 750 million years ago.

Now, they think that a few billion years ago Venus might have also been WAY cooler like a balmy 20 to 50 degrees on average and it may have even been habitable!

They're still not sure what happened to make Venus change so much but they say knowing more about the history of the planets in our solar system can help us learn more about our planet and its future.

xadMBUnjvzg,Climate crisis – a race we can win. Why don’t we act? | Thina Margrethe Saltvedt | TEDxArendal,"The potential global impacts of the climate crisis are slower to materialise, but much graver than those from Covid-19. 

Actions to be taken are urgent!

In all these years we have known about climate changes, why have we not managed to mobilise a bold collective action to combat this crisis?

Dr Saltvedt has paid special interest to two potential explanations that can slow down the green transition; Market Failure (failure of a market to deliver an optimal result) and Path dependency. In this talk she focuses on how to move away from the dependency of the high emission path and to develop a new green path dependence – a new history - a system change that involves the whole society. 
 Thina Margrethe Saltvedt is Chief Analyst at the Group Sustainability Nordea Bank. She worked over 12 years as an oil analyst, before leaving it all behind.

Thina is a member of the Minister of Climate and Environment’s Climate Council. Thina has a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) degree in Economics and a Master of Science (MSc) degree in International Business from University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), United Kingdom.

dwZWb7Mzsy0,How can marketing help solve our climate crisis? | Ellie Moss | TEDxDarlinghurst,"How do you harness the dark arts of marketing for good? With climate change still being such a polarising issue, is there a better way we can cut through and encourage more people to become climate advocates? In this marketing masterclass, Ellie Moss explains how understanding human motivators can help deliver relevant, targeted messages in a way in which they would change their behaviour towards more sustainable and eco-friendly practices. Done the right way, marketing has the power to encourage everyone to take positive action towards climate change. Ellie Moss is a professional contradiction: a marketer who is passionate about the environment, sustainability and being a positive force in the fight against climate change.
 
In her role as Managing & Strategic Director at Focus Creative, Ellie applies marketing and communications strategy to coffee beans, home building and clean energy—often in the same week. Sustainability frameworks, green comms strategy, and environmental campaigns are what puts a spring in her step.
 
As a child, Ellie took food packaging home from school to ensure it was recycled. That obsession never left her. Now she enjoys using the dark arts of marketing for good.
 
Ellie is fascinated by human behaviour and the power of marketing communication to create behaviour change and, ultimately, save the planet.

We bring to you the best videos from your favorite show Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah. So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.

About Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in ""Gokuldham Co-operative Society"" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.

fL5Sp9ZIaxM,Global Warming Facts - Unlimited Entertainment #shorts #reels #foryou #fyp #trends #viral #funny,"Global Warming: Causes, Effects, and Solutions

Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average temperature due to human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels. This leads to climate change, causing extreme weather, rising sea levels, and environmental imbalances.

Causes of Global Warming

1. Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) – Carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) trap heat in the atmosphere.


2. Fossil Fuels – Burning coal, oil, and gas for energy releases CO₂.


3. Deforestation – Cutting down trees reduces Earth's ability to absorb CO₂.


4. Industrial & Agricultural Activities – Factories, livestock farming, and chemical fertilizers release GHGs.


5. Waste & Pollution – Landfills and plastic waste contribute to methane emissions.



Effects of Global Warming

Rising Temperatures – Earth's temperature has increased by 1.2°C (2.2°F) since pre-industrial times.

Melting Ice & Rising Sea Levels – Glaciers and polar ice caps are melting, leading to coastal flooding.

Extreme Weather – More heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires.

Biodiversity Loss – Many species are going extinct due to habitat destruction.

Food & Water Shortages – Climate changes affect agriculture and freshwater availability.


Solutions to Global Warming

1. Switch to Renewable Energy – Use solar, wind, and hydropower instead of fossil fuels.


2. Reduce Deforestation – Plant trees and protect forests.


3. Use Energy Efficiently – Turn off lights, use energy-saving appliances.


4. Eco-Friendly Transportation – Use public transport, electric cars, or cycle.


5. Reduce Waste & Plastic Use – Recycle and compost to cut methane emissions.


6. Support Climate Policies – Encourage governments to take action on climate change.



Future of Global Warming

If we don’t act, temperatures could rise by 3-4°C by 2100, causing catastrophic damage. However, if we reduce emissions and switch to sustainable solutions, we can slow down climate change.

Would you like to know about how global warming specifically affects your region or the latest scientific research on it?

Countries Most Affected by Global Warming

Some countries are more vulnerable to global warming due to their geography, economy, and climate conditions. Here are the nations most impacted by rising temperatures, extreme weather, and sea-level rise:

1. Bangladesh

One of the most climate-vulnerable countries.

Faces severe flooding, cyclones, and rising sea levels.

Over 15 million people may be displaced by 2050.


2. India

Increasing heatwaves, droughts, and unpredictable monsoons.

Rising temperatures affect agriculture and water supply.

Air pollution and deforestation worsen climate effects.


3. Pakistan

Experiences deadly heatwaves, floods, and water shortages.

The 2022 floods submerged one-third of the country.

Melting Himalayan glaciers threaten water sources.


4. The Philippines

Hit by strong typhoons, rising sea levels, and extreme heat.

ba-kW2_eo2s,US and China announce joint efforts to cut carbon emissions | DW News,"The surprise climate pact from the world's biggest polluters signals political willingness — but is light on details China's climate envoy announced a deal on Wednesday to boost cooperation with the United States to combat the climate crisis. The announcement came as negotiations at the UN climate conference approached their conclusion, with the goal of securing final pledges before it wraps up on Friday. It also comes after US President Joe Biden criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping for not making an appearance at the UN climate conference in Glasgow. The US and China are the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters — accounting for around 40% of global emissions.

What did Beijing and Washington agree?
China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said the plan would involve ""concrete plans"" for enhanced action this decade and a willingness for the US and China to talk about the ""finalization of the Paris Agreement rulebook."" The Paris Climate Agreement dates back to COP21, which was held in 2016 in Paris.

The joint statement itself is less clear with concrete details, but carries more political significance as the two economic rivals pledged to put aside differences to tackle climate change. The agreement does, however, contain a specific focus on curbing methane emissions. Beijing and Washington have also agreed to meet regularly to address climate issues and both ""recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis. The US has set a goal to reach ""100% carbon pollution-free electricity"" by the year 2035. China, meanwhile pledged to ""phase down"" coal consumption.

ej51wZYp2Cw,N.J. wildfire shuts major highway and forces thousands to evacuate,"A fast-moving wildfire in the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey forced the evacuation of about 3,000 people and temporarily shut down part of the Garden State Parkway on Tuesday.

The Jones Road Forest Fire burned roughly 8,500 acres with only 10% containment by late evening, threatening over 1,300 structures.

No injuries were reported.

The fire started amid high fire risk and drought conditions, with climate change cited as a contributing factor, Axios has reported.

Cooler temperatures and lighter winds were expected to help overnight.

3Uec3qp37iY,Sustainable Timber Building Technologies for Zero Carbon Emissions,"Recorded on November 19, 2024 as part of the UBC Forestry Research Lunch Seminar Series

Following Canada’s commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, there has been an increased drive toward a carbon-neutral built environment. Since the building sector accounts for over 12% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, governments and industries are promoting innovative low-carbon building materials and systems to achieve zero-carbon buildings, such as bio-based materials, phase-change materials, and salvaged materials.

This talk will present current research on sustainable timber building technologies, including sustainable building concepts, mass timber applications, deconstruction, and design for disassembly. It will also explain how these timber-related technologies could contribute to achieving zero carbon emissions.

Speaker
Haibo Feng received his PhD training in UBC Civil Engineering in the field of Sustainable Construction. He was an Assistant Professor for over 2 years at Northumbria University in the UK before joining the Department of Wood Science at UBC Forestry. He also worked in construction industry for over 6 years on construction management and sustainable building design.

Dr. Feng’s research area is in green building, building information modeling, life cycle assessment and building energy performance. He has extensive industrial and research experience on promoting sustainable building construction with the integration of advanced building systems and renewable energy supports. He has practical knowledge on carbon accounting (e.g., EPD) and building rating systems including LEED, BREEAM, Passive house, BC Energy STEP Code, Zero Carbon Building. His work focuses on integrating innovative technologies into sustainable building design to achieve low carbon buildings with the consideration of social and economic impacts. He is particularly interested in using mass timber products to promote zero-carbon timber frame buildings. He also has extensive local and global experience in sustainable building design and construction management. He will continue his research on the development of Sustainable Built Environment Centre.",2024-12-05T21:08:07Z,UCPAizyAWJizn4eG0rzLNE1w,UBC Forestry,[],80,3,0,PT56M17S,27,none,2250,209,2272331

http://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home/programmes.html?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=ACQUISITION

Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil or natural gas moves cars, produces electricity or heat. Unfortunately, it also generates carbon dioxide emissions, and drives climate change. 

The European Union has decided to strongly reduce emissions. Obviously this should be done at the lowest costs to the firms and the people. 

That is where the Emissions Trading comes into play: 

The European Union fixes a carbon emissions target, then divides it into allowances, that each allow to emit one ton of CO2. These are now distributed to the firms. Now, for every ton of emissions, the firm needs to turn in one allowance. If it needs more or less, it can buy or sell them. 

So there will be a market for allowances. A firm will now think twice before it emits carbon dioxide: 
- If it is cheaper to avoid a ton of emissions and sell an allowance then the firm will do that. 
- But also: The firm may choose to emit more and just buy an allowance if that increases profit. 

Therefore, the firms will end up in a situation where they all face the same costs if they would want to avoid an additional ton of CO2. 

That means: The cheap abatement options are used – and at the same time no firm is forced to use particularly expensive ways to reduce emissions as it can always buy allowances. 

In other words: the economy has reached the emissions target in the cheapest way.",2017-02-23T15:08:16Z,UCwqdU0Q9AVnE5xEAWwHXmvQ,Frankfurt School of Finance & Management,"['carbon emission', 'carbon emissions trading', 'emission', 'carbon', 'trading', 'faculty', 'frankfurt school', 'lexikon', 'dictionary', 'united nations', 'environment', 'global', 'global trends', 'renewable', 'enrgy finance', 'renewable energy', 'fsinsights', 'co2']",56370,403,13,PT1M43S,27,none,22700,322,4071042
WLboaYVNLtg,Climate Change Devastates Alaska Village as Global Warming Intensifies | WION Climate Tracker,"An Alaska village has been devastated by the impacts of climate change, highlighting the growing threat of global warming. Rising temperatures have accelerated coastal erosion, melting permafrost, and increased flooding, forcing residents to relocate as their homes and infrastructure are destroyed. This disaster is a stark reminder of the escalating environmental crisis driven by global warming, which continues to disrupt vulnerable communities and ecosystems worldwide. Experts warn that without immediate action to curb emissions, more areas could face similar destruction in the coming years.

Max Planck Institute for Meteorology: Weaker ocean circulation could cost trillions
https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/communication/news/weaker-ocean-circulation-could-cost-trillions

Climate Visualization Laboratory YouTube: Following the upper and lower limbs of the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation)

With large incoming solar radiation in tropical regions, upper layers of the Atlantic Ocean gain heat at low latitudes. Ocean currents are set in motion to re-distribute heat to higher latitudes, warming up the atmosphere along their path and contributing to mild weather conditions over Europe.  This corresponds to the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation -  AMOC. 

At high latitudes, the cooled and densified surface waters go deeper and return back south, making up the lower AMOC limb. We can track water movement by visualizing particles. Length of particle trails is proportional to the velocity of the ocean current and their color to the ocean temperature. Vigorous warm currents flow North along the western Atlantic boundary. The North Brazil Current, breaks up into strongly rotating circular eddies, then feeds flow into the Caribbean. Away from boundaries, particle trails are shorter, meaning weaker velocities. Gulf of Mexico current makes a sharp turn into the Florida Straits adding to one of the largest current systems in the World: the Gulf Stream. Energetic eddies rotate for a long time around their centers.  Some currents escape the eddies and flow east, continuing in the Azores Current and some move North. Further north, the Gulf Stream continues as the weaker less defined North Atlantic Current. 

Some flow continues to Nordic Seas then partially recirculates in the subpolar north Atlantic, into the Labrador Sea. Surface waters lose some of the heat and become cold thus dense. In the Labrador Sea, harsh winter conditions make the surface water even colder and denser so it is heavier than water below so it sinks deeper. Once at depths around 1000 to 2000 meters, it encounters water of similar densities and flows south. Below 2000 meters depth the so-called Deep Western Boundary Current forms lower AMOC limb, starting at the southern tip of Greenland following the continental slope. At the exit of the Labrador Sea, it goes around Flemish Cap and enters region below the Gulf Stream. 

Flow in upper layers is so strong that currents deeper than 2000m feel movement and are entangled into eddies. Directly at the boundary, currents progress slowly southwards. Flow below 2000m south from Gulf Stream eddy region is mostly confined to continental slope and follows bottom topography. Along South America, the continental slope is interrupted by large underwater promontories which the Deep Western Boundary Current circumvents. Meanders and eddies are generated; flow gets unstable. Flow is disrupted into eddies and no longer flows as a well-defined current. Lower limb of the AMOC becomes dominated by ocean eddies.

Peer-reviewed scientific paper: Weakening AMOC reduces ocean carbon uptake and increases
the social cost of carbon

Abstract
A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.

Alex is an energy expert who believes that our planet has all the necessary resources to support all the people on it and then some. He also believes that the planet is warming and that our reliance on fossil fuels is partly to blame. He is by no means a “climate change denier,” but he does NOT believe that fossil fuels should be limited or replaced by alternatives. Far from it. Alex believes that oil, coal, and natural gas are the best hope for human flourishing and that their actual impact on the climate can only be properly evaluated if we first understand their overall impact on humanity.

lrkT_b6UWY4,Malcolm Turnbull has now been 'dumped three times over climate action',"Sky News host Chris Kenny says ""Malcolm Turnbull has now been dumped three times over climate action"" after he was dropped from heading up the NSW Net Zero Emissions and Clean Economy Board following his appointment last week.

""There is a fair bit to say about the former prime minister being appointed last week to head the NSW net-zero emissions board, and then being dumped today and the first thing is that this was an inconceivably dumb appointment,"" he said.

""But even if we put all that personal and political animosity to one side, the main reason the former prime minister was not the right person to head up the NSW net-zero emissions board is climate and energy policy has been his Achilles heel.

""Yes, I worked for him in 2009 when, as opposition leader,  he tried to do a deal with Labor over their emissions trading scheme, it split his party and cost him the leadership.

""Then nearly a decade later, after he'd become prime minister, he tried another climate and energy policy, one that could only succeed if it satisfied Labor, and again his party split, and dumped him.

""So imagine the idiocy of the NSW government appointing him to advise on a policy area where he had failed twice, divided the coalition both times.

""Turnbull should have seen this coming and rejected the job but the main blame lies with the NSW minister Matt Kean and a Cabinet that went along with this wild idea.""",2021-04-06T07:49:37Z,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,Sky News Australia,"['6246811827001', 'fb', 'kenny', 'msn', 'yt']",8491,424,184,PT6M4S,25,none,5480000,186023,6205475458

gJgaUnvh9Og,Reducing Cooling Demand And Carbon Emissions Are A Priority  | Energy Transition Dialogue 2023,"The Energy Transition Dialogue 2023 | Low Carbon, Comfort and Cooling Coalition—Scaling Up Adoption of Low Carbon Cooling Designs and Technologies | Energy transition in the Global South represents a pivotal and complex journey towards sustainable, low-carbon, and equitable energy systems. Amidst development challenges and energy access disparities, these countries recognise the need to move away from fossil fuels to achieve climate resilience and energy security. This transition entails multifaceted efforts, including the expansion of renewable energy sources, enhancement of energy efficiency, and the deployment of innovative technologies. Moreover, the transition is intimately tied to social and economic development. It must seek to empower marginalised communities, create employment opportunities, and improve living standards for all. This will require mainstreaming people’s aspirations into the discussions around energy transitions and plan forward-thinking interventions, that go beyond energy policy alone, to ensure the energy transition is inclusive and prosperous.

It is also clear that it will be near impossible for developing economies to achieve this transition with domestic resources alone, the international community will have to step up its effort to support both in terms of finances and technology.

In this context, The Energy Transition Dialogue 2023, will convene both domestic and international stakeholders to critically assess prevailing narratives surrounding inclusive energy transitions. The Dialogue will gather thought-leaders, policymakers, and experts from the private sector, financial services and civil society to deliberate and devise solutions to these critical issues with the objective to advance a people-positive energy transition in the Global South, with a specific focus on India.

U4z3ZV8zcdE,Countries Pledge to Curb Global Carbon Emissions at Biden's Climate Summit,"President Joe Biden brought the U.S. back into the global fight against climate change on Thursday, pledging at an international summit he convened to halve emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030 and double climate aid to developing nations.

Poor countries made clear at the summit that they expect money from wealthier nations in exchange for accelerating their own efforts to curb warming, while China and India stuck to plans to continue growing their own carbon emissions before making any cuts, dismaying environmentalists who say the world remains on course toward catastrophe.

Biden announced in opening remarks for the two-day summit that the U.S. will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 50%-52% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade -- significantly boosting a commitment made under former President Barack Obama that was scrapped by former President Donald Trump.

“No nation can solve this crisis on our own,” Biden said Thursday from the White House. “All of us, and particularly those of us who represent the world’s largest economies, we have to step up.”

A key UN body said in a report that there must be ""rapid, deep and immediate"" cuts in carbon dioxide emissions.

Global emissions of CO2 would need to peak within three years to stave off the worst impacts.

Even then, the world would also need technology to suck CO2 from the skies by mid-century.

The Paris Agreement was an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation.  It is a legally binding international treaty on climate change.  It was adopted by 196 countries at Conference of the Parties COP 21 in Paris in December 2015.

The goal of Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius, and preferably limit it to 1.5° Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

This session will cover topics such as:
1. Introduction (00:00)
2. Paris Agreement (0:56)
3. Katowice Rulebook (18:43)
4. Question - How are we tracking process? (22:37)
5. India Ratifies Paris Climate Deal (25:39)

Watch Knowledge Series session on Kyoto Protocol here: https://youtu.be/UComv_d6tbo

Some of the key aspects of the topic covered in this session are the Paris climate agreement, detailed features of the Paris agreement on climate change, Paris agreement 2015, Paris agreement goals, Paris agreement countries, and important questions on the Paris agreement for UPSC.

The Paris Agreement is the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement under UNFCCC, adopted at the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015. It was adopted by 196 Parties and entered into force in 2016. It sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming. 

To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century.

Katowice Rulebook

The Katowice package adopted at the UN climate conference (COP24) in December 2018 contains common and detailed rules, procedures and guidelines that operationalise the Paris Agreement.

It covers all key areas, including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation, and provides flexibility to Parties that need it in light of their capacities while enabling them to implement and report on their commitments in a transparent, complete, comparable and consistent manner.

nDzX5XfJ_oU,S.Korea's Climate Change Week: Tackling local and global Challenges in fight against Climate Change,"전 세계 이상기후 현주소와 기후위기 대응 방안은?

Welcome to Within The Frame, where we bring the most pressing issues across the globe into focus. I'm Kim Mok-yeon.
This week, South Korea is celebrating Climate Change Week, dedicated to raising awareness about the impacts of climate change and promoting actions towards carbon neutrality and climate adaptation. 
As the nation grapples with more unpredictable weather patterns — such as unseasonal snowfalls in April and heavy rainfall — the urgency for climate action has never been more apparent. 
With a focus on both immediate and long-term solutions, South Korea has rolled out initiatives like the ""Carbon-Neutral Points System"" and ""Climate Insurance"" to protect vulnerable groups from the growing effects of climate-related disasters. 
But these are just the beginning.
To discuss the broader picture today, joining us are two distinguished experts. 

We are joined by Chung Suh-yong, Professor of International Studies at Korea University. Welcome.

We also connect to Aiguo Dai, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences at the University of Albany, SUNY. Great to have you.

(CHUNG) 1. This week marks South Korea's Climate Change Week, a pivotal moment to highlight the country's commitment to carbon neutrality. Given the recent unusual weather patterns — such as snowfall in April and intense rainfall across the nation — could you elaborate on the critical need for heightened climate awareness in South Korea?

(DAI) 2. Professor Dai, as a global expert on atmospheric and environmental patterns, you’ve observed devastating floods in Bolivia and early heatwaves in India and Pakistan. Given these events, how do you foresee the frequency of such extreme weather phenomena increasing, and what are the key global drivers behind these shifts?

(DAI) 3. Agriculture, as we know, is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change, with unpredictable weather significantly affecting crop yields. Could you share some of the innovative global solutions that are being implemented to help farmers adapt, and what lessons could be applied to other regions facing similar challenges?

(CHUNG) 4. In response to growing climate risks, the Korean government has introduced the ""Climate Insurance"" system to support vulnerable communities impacted by extreme weather events. What is your assessment of this approach, and how effective do you think it could be in mitigating the damage from frequent climate-related disasters in South Korea?

(CHUNG) 5. Alongside this, South Korea has rolled out initiatives like the ""Carbon-Neutral Points System"" to encourage public participation in climate action. How would you evaluate the effectiveness of these programs in fostering widespread engagement, and what further measures could be taken to increase public participation in the country's climate efforts?

(DAI) 6. Many countries, including South Korea, are striving to achieve carbon neutrality. From your perspective, what role does international cooperation play in achieving these ambitious global climate targets, and how can nations collaborate more effectively to share knowledge and resources in managing climate-related risks?

(CHUNG) 7. As one of the world’s leading industrial nations, South Korea faces the challenge of balancing its rapid industrial growth with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions. In your view, which sectors should South Korea prioritize in this transition, and what are the key strategies for balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility?

(DAI) 8. Looking at international climate agreements such as the Paris Agreement, how would you evaluate the current progress in their implementation, particularly in light of the increasing frequency and severity of climate disasters worldwide? What more needs to be done on a global scale to ensure these commitments translate into meaningful action?

(DAI) 9. From a global standpoint, what do you believe are the most effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change? Are there specific actions that developing nations should focus on to reduce their vulnerability to climate-related risks, while still promoting sustainable development?

(CHUNG) 10. Finally, Professor Chung, in what areas do you believe South Korea can lead the global fight against climate change? And as individuals, what steps can we take to contribute meaningfully to addressing the climate crisis?

v-ArA_xYxfs,Global Warming in the Pipeline,"Dr. Peter Carter, Paul Beckwith and Regina Valdez discuss a recent paper called ‘Global Warming in the Pipeline’ by James Hansen et al. The paper explains global warming will likely pierce the 1.5°C ceiling in the 2020s and 2°C before 2050 under the current geopolitical approach to dealing with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

This video was recorded on May 24th, 2023, and published on June 18th, 2023, and represents the opinions of the discussion participants. 

Some of the topics discussed:
- How one of the key characteristics of climate change known for decades has always been inertia and momentum. This paper shows that at the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the planet is slowly moving towards a 10°C rise in global average temperature.
- How James Hansen is a voice crying in the climate wilderness as he always seems to have been because the scientific community is not agreeing with him.
- How one of the big feedbacks in the climate system is ice sheet albedo and its key role in leading us to a 10°C rise.
- How the methane emissions feedback from the warming of the wetlands will be inevitable.
- How a new draft of the paper was released on May 19th.
- How the Global Climate Models (GCMs) have been under predicting the global average temperature rates of change and how by using the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), which is how much the climate warms for a doubling of CO2 levels, we can arrive at much more accurate prediction of global average temperature rise from paleoclimate data.
- The enormity of consequences of climate change demands a return to a Holocene-level global temperature with the required actions that include: 1) A global increasing price on GHG emissions; 2) An East-West cooperation in a way that accommodates developing world needs; 3) Intervention with Earth’s radiation imbalance to phase down today’s massive human-made “geo-transformation” of Earth’s climate.
- and much more. . .

R9xp4YwpTg0,The Climate Crisis in Polar Regions with Dr. Jim Halfpenny,"Dr. Jim Halfpenny is a renowned polar ecologist, expedition leader, and expert in cold-climate ecology with decades of experience studying the extreme environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. With a background in wildlife biology and ecology, Dr. Halfpenny has led and participated in numerous scientific expeditions to the polar regions, where he has conducted groundbreaking research on climate change, snow ecology, and the adaptation of wildlife to some of the planet’s harshest conditions.

Dr. Halfpenny's firsthand accounts paint a vivid picture of climate change's impact: shrinking glaciers, thawing permafrost releasing dangerous methane, and indigenous communities forced to relocate due to shifting wildlife patterns. His upcoming book ""The Last Cold"" documents these profound changes, while his research using ice cores reveals how current CO2 levels far exceed anything seen in the past 800,000 years.

Despite passing certain environmental tipping points, Dr. Halfpenny emphasizes hope through action and the importance of individual contributions to combat climate change. From infrastructure challenges in Alaska to the transformation of the Northwest Passage into a potential trade route, this episode offers crucial insights into our warming world.

Don't miss this essential conversation about one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Listen now to understand why the Arctic's story is everyone's story.

He said: ""The current battle against the coronavirus at least demonstrates, if nothing else, how quickly the world can mobilise when we identify a common threat.""

Prince Charles' comments came during a speech to delegates at a WaterAid event looking at the impact of climate change on drinking water.

In fact, one of the most immediate and impactful opportunities we have to address climate change is decarbonizing our building sector, which accounted for 31% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022!

The best part? The federal government is not the primary driver of building decarbonization. Commercial property owners can choose to install clean energy appliances like heat pumps and solar panels. State governments shape building codes and utility regulations. Local governments control zoning and permitting. And you get to decide what happens in your own home!
In this Climate Action Party you’ll hear from a panel of leaders who are making clean energy homes a reality:

The Co-Founder of Electrify Now, who’s helping homeowners on their electrification journeys;
The Co-Founder of Bright Saver, a new nonprofit making plug-in solar more accessible than it's ever been; and a senior policy leader from Rewiring America, whose work is driving electrification across homes, states, and markets.

You’ll also be invited to take tangible action through the free Climate Action Now app, telling decision-makers all around the country about the benefits of clean energy buildings and some of the policies they can implement to accelerate the shift!

This Earth Day, join us for a Climate Action Party to explore one of the most actionable, hopeful climate solutions: building decarbonization!

About Our Action Parties
An Action Party is an online event that packs valuable information and concrete action into a 60-minute venue.

Each Action Party has an environment-related topic and features guests who are experts in that topic. We begin with a 10 minute presentation, followed by a panel discussion and optional action-taking with the Climate Action Now app. The actions have been prepared in advance to help participants take the most impactful action in the shortest period of time. While we take action together, the party's host sets a goal for the number of actions to be taken and shows participants their progress towards that goal in real time with an online, automated goal tracker. Participants are invited to share their questions for our panelists in the chat throughout the Action Party.

Action Parties are free and open to all who seek a more just and sustainable world, but we welcome donations to help us continue our mission of creating a just and liveable planet for all.

How to Get the Climate Action Now App
If you want to participate in the action-taking segment, you can get the free Climate Action Now app by scanning the QR code below with your phone's camera, or by searching for ""Climate Action Now"" in your app store and downloading it to your phone.

We've got a big ol' task ahead of us and it's important to start our collective engines (figurative, not literal) on reducing our government's fossil fuel use. It's going to take an effort on the scale of the new deal (but like a ... I dunno, green one or something) and we'll need to keep climate change front of mind for the foreseeable future if we want to have a shot of pressuring corporations and government into doing the right thing.

Gbit6GB-xfs,Climate action: How to tackle 90% of emissions,"The time for action on climate is now! All countries must play their part. There is a lot more governments can do to reduce emissions and address climate change. By focusing on five economic sectors, we can tackle nearly 90% of emissions. Industry, electricity, agriculture, transport and buildings are the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Cutting these greenhouse gas emissions is key to sustainable and healthy lives, and livelihoods. Taking the right climate policy actions  now, can get us on track to achieve our climate targets by 2025. And they will help us change our lives for the better too.

The OECD supports and helps drive higher levels of ambition and tangible outcomes – on mitigation, adaptation and resilience, and financing – that better align with the collective goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes enhanced support for climate action in developing countries, including in the least developed and most vulnerable countries, which are heavily impacted by climate change, but lack access to tools required to support a transition to net-zero emissions.

Our goal is to shape policies that foster prosperity, equality, opportunity and well-being for all. Together with governments, policy makers, policy shapers, and citizens, we work on establishing evidence-based international standards and finding solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. 

From improving economic performance and creating jobs to fostering strong education and fighting international tax evasion, we provide a unique forum and knowledge hub for data and analysis, exchange of experiences, best-practice sharing, and advice on public policies and international standard-setting. To learn more about the OECD, our global reach, and how to join us, go to https://www.oecd.org/about/.  To keep up with latest at the OECD, visit https://www.oecd.org/.

McNab Lecture in the History of Science. This year's lecture entitled ""The Future Is Now, Solving the climate crisis with today's technology"" will be given by Canadian author and science journalist Bob McDonald. The lecture will be followed by a Q&A moderated by Dr. Joe Schwarcz, Director of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society.

Lecture summary: Let's start with the good news. All the technology to go green already exists. There is no shortage of energy on earth, it falls out of the sky, blows on the wind, flows on the tides, bubbles out of the ground and literally grows on trees. This presentation is an update on alternative green energy and how we can move to a low carbon lifestyle without breaking the economy.

zy7vUppYPC8,Will renewables stop the climate crisis? | DW Documentary,"Mankind is facing the greatest upheaval since industrialization. To stop climate change, the energy system must be transformed worldwide and fossil fuels must be completely replaced. But is this even possible?

Time is running out. If climate targets are still to be met and the survival of future generations is to be ensured, virtually all fossil energy sources worldwide will have to be replaced by renewables by 2050. That leaves us with almost exactly one generation from today to make this massive change. So what needs to happen for the global energy transition to succeed?

Part 1 of this two-part documentary looks at the question of whether it’s even possible to provide enough green energy for the whole world. How can the oil economy be replaced? The film travels to places that could one day become the Saudi Arabia of renewable energies. For example, gigantic offshore wind farms in the North Sea, or the most modern solar fields in Spain. One day, these regions will supply all of Europe with electricity.

However, the globally increasing demand for energy must be met in ways that are both sustainable and affordable. Researchers at the Technical University of Ilmenau in Thuringia are working with a team from the California Institute of Technology on high-tech materials that will make renewable energies more efficient and less expensive than their fossil fuel predecessors.

Oil Companies Hope So.,"""An Open Sewer"" that's how Former Vice President Al Gore, at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos said that we're treating the atmosphere given the amount of CO2 we're dumping in it. But what if we could take back the Carbon from the atmosphere and store it or, even better, remove it completely? Could that fix the Climate Crisis and get us to Net Zero? That's the hope of Carbon Capture and Storage and Carbon Dioxide Removal Companies and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Oil Companies. So we thought it was time to find out whether CCS and CDR is an effective solution, or an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels or even, a necessary sidekick to renewable energy. Join Helen as she investigates this contentious topic.

6VcN38cn6tQ,S. Korea finalizes plan to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030,"2030 온실가스 감축목표 최종안…""40% 감축 목표""

The government aims to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by the year 2030,... and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
After Cabinet approval next week, the country will announce the new target at the November UN Climate Change Conference.
Kim Min-ji explains further.
South Korea's carbon reduction target of 40 percent by 2030 reflects the country's strong determination to achieve carbon neutrality and its sense of responsibility as a member of the international community.
That's according to President Moon Jae-in Monday as the country finalized its blueprint for zero-out emissions by 2050.
The new target, known as the nationally determined contribution, is a dramatic hike from the current goal... of a 26-point-3 percent drop from 2018 levels the year the country's emissions peaked.

""The country's fate depends on this. The government will not toss the burden to companies, but will spare no effort in terms of policy and fiscal support. It is also time for action by the public.""

Moon said that it's an ambitious target noting the concerns of industry and labor about whether the country can manage,... especially as the manufacturing sector takes up a large portion of the country's industrial structure.
In fact, South Korea needs to reduce its emissions by over 4 percent a year on average until 2030 which is about twice as much as countries whose emissions peaked earlier... in the 1990s or 2000s.

The government on Monday also finalized two scenarios for net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050 to give the country flexibility given that conditions can change focusing on developing and expanding sources for carbon absorption.
The president noted that over 10 billion U.S. dollars has been earmarked from next year's budget for the initiative.
Moon pointed out the need for a transition to renewable energy... and to supply more electric and hydrogen powered cars.

""It is an ambitious goal toward a path that no one has taken before. It's an era where low-carbon technologies will determine a nation's competitiveness. The government will increase investment for tech development and spare no effort to find new growth engines and create new jobs to lead the carbon neutral era.""

Monday's proposals will be subject to Cabinet approval next week after which South Korea will announce at the UN climate change conference in Glasgow in November.

Colossal explosions shake a remote corner of the Siberian tundra, leaving behind massive sinkholes. In Alaska, a huge lake erupts with bubbles of inflammable gas. Scientists are discovering that these mystifying phenomena add up to a ticking time bomb, as long-frozen permafrost melts and releases vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. What are the implications of these dramatic developments in the Arctic? Scientists and local communities alike are struggling to grasp the scale of the methane threat and what it means for our climate future.

8DiWzvE52ZY,Gojira - Global Warming [Live at the Silver Cord Studio May 2018],"A few weeks ago, we played Global Warming together for the first time since the recording of From Mars To Sirius (2004). We never played it live before, as it is a challenging one to play, and place in a set list. It’s emotionally heavy, and would almost “hurt” the rest of the songs in a way. We just really wanted to do this on camera for  our fans.  Global warming is a reality and a relevant topic, we feel it’s good to be reminded of one of the most important challenges of our time: How to grow as a species without being a parasite to our planet, the only home we have. “We will see our children growing” is a mantra for future generations, and in a figurative way we hope the children in all of us will grow, evolve, and take action for a more compassionate and meaningful world.

How to calculate and reduce it? | Climate change,"The idea of a personal carbon footprint was popularized by a large advertising campaign of the fossil fuel company BP in 2005. This piece of propaganda was designed to shift the responsibility of carbon emissions from the company to the public.

📝 Erratum: @3:30 the vertical axis of the graph should read ""CO2 concentration"" not temperatures, and the voice-over should say ""CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is the highest it has ever been in 400,000."" Temperature will follow but fortunately, they are not there yet. 

In this whiteboard animation, I explain what we mean by carbon footprint (definition), how it is calculated, why we need to reduce it and how to reduce it with lots of examples. I also suggest 3 carbon footprint calculators you can use:

sMLpKuXXzBM,Facing Climate Anxiety: SUNY ESF Panel Reframes the Climate Crisis as a Mental Health Fight,"For over five decades, Earth Day has been a call to action for environmental change — but at SUNY ESF, this year’s Earth Week took a more personal turn. In this NCC News report, Jack Stankey covers a powerful panel discussion that explored climate anxiety — a growing emotional toll on students and activists grappling with the uncertainty of our planet’s future.

DKDq1RMHscQ,What is Carbon Footprint? - Environmental Science for Kids | Educational Videos by Mocomi,"https://mocomi.com/ presents: What is Carbon Footprint?

Do you know what is carbon footprint and how to reduce it?

Your Carbon Footprint is the amount of Carbon Dioxide and Methane gas you release into the environment by consuming energy.

Most energy produced in the world is done by burning fossil fuels such as petroleum and gas. You may not experience it directly but everything you do requires energy. You need petrol to create energy to drive your car, gas to light your stove, and even the paper you write on in school requires energy to be transformed from wood to books.

There is no clean way to burn fossil fuels. No matter how you do it, you will produce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the process. Hence, Your carbon footprint is the total amount of carbon dioxide and methane gas you release into the environment by consuming energy.

To get a better idea of how consuming something adds to your carbon footprint take the example of paper. Let’s say that plants take 5 units of energy to become trees. It takes 1 unit to cut down the tree and 3 units to transport it to a factory. The factory takes another 5 units to convert this tree into paper. Finally another 1 unit is used to transport that paper to your city. This means that when you buy the book it is worth 15 units of energy.

It may take you less than 1 unit of energy to throw a book into the dustbin but in reality you are chucking away 15 units of energy. Now think of every person in the whole world throwing away just 1 book and you get 7 billion X 15 units of energy when someone simply throws away a book

Watch this video to understand how our everyday activities add to our Carbon Footprint and how we can conserve energy.

Subscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub

Millions have been driven from their homes by flood, fire or drought, while food and energy shortages are becoming acute in many regions.

But what has taken us so long for meaningful action to save our planet?

""People are saying the climate crisis is real, only because it has knocked on the door of the global north,"" says Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate.

The 54 countries in Africa combined account for 15% of the world’s population but contribute less than 4% of global greenhouse emissions – in contrast to 23% by China, 19% by the US, and 13% from the European Union. Right now, more than 18 million people are facing severe hunger due to extreme droughts in the Horn of Africa.

The countries suffering the worst effects of climate change are not the ones who caused the climate crisis. Here 25-year-old Vanessa Nakate speaks about about this extreme climate injustice, and what needs to be done about it.

Cop27 takes place in November this year in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Countries from across Africa – and the wider global south – will be looking to secure billions of dollars of climate financing for adaptation and the green energy transition, as well as separate funds for loss and damage and reparations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Climate change denial draws headlines. But is it actually an obstacle to climate action?

A great majority of Americans say they're concerned about climate change.

The real roadblock is our unwillingness to pay money to help stop climate change.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAVID WALLACE-WELLS:

David Wallace-Wells is a national fellow at the New America Foundation and a columnist and deputy editor at New York magazine. He was previously the deputy editor of The Paris Review. He lives in New York City.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

DAVID WALLACE-WELLS: I basically don't think that denial is as big a problem as many in America do. The data show now that 73% of Americans believe global warming is real and happening now. 70% of them are concerned about it. You can get an enormous amount politically done if you have the support of 70% of the country. I think those numbers are also moving, and so they'll grow over the coming years. For me, the much bigger problem is that even though Americans are concerned about climate change, nobody wants to spend as much as $10 a month to address it. 

The median commitment, a recent poll found, was just $1 a month. So while people are concerned about climate change, they're not concerned enough. And my personal perspective is that the main goal for climate action is to make those people who are concerned, but still fundamentally complacent about the issue, to be really engaged in a way that they prioritize climate change in their politics and their voting and make sure that our leaders think of climate change as a first order political priority, not a third or fourth order political priority, and maybe even a political imperative that governs all others, because that is true. 

If you care about economic inequality, if you care about violence, basically every political thing that you could worry about in this world bears the fingerprint of climate change, and will be made worse if climate change continues unabated. So addressing any of them on some level means addressing climate change, and that's the perspective I think we really need to have or more of us need to have. There is a real concern about preaching to the choir, I don't think of that as being an issue of people like me, that is people who were up until quite recently aware of climate, worried about it, but who didn't orient their lives around it. 

I think that there's a bigger risk of advocates and activists talking to one another and not addressing the sort of median concerned liberal, who is worried, but fundamentally complacent. That, to me, is the main target of messaging. And when I look around the world, I see many, many more people like that, many more societies like that than I see people who are really deeply committed or who are really deeply in denial. And I say that as someone who felt that way myself until quite recently and who was awakened from that complacency by fear and alarm, which is one reason why I think that talking bluntly about the science and everything that it projects for our near-term future is really important. 

We shouldn't shy away from the projections that science has made for us. We should look squarely at them as we can be, even if they horrify us, because fear can be mobilizing, can be motivating. We know that from environmental history. We know that from advocacy history. In this case, I don't think it needs to be the only way that we talk about climate change, but we shouldn't be scared of fear. We should know that the impacts are terrifying and that we need to do everything we can to avoid as many of them as we can.

↓ More info below ↓

We asked six experts where the safest, or least risky, places will be to live in the United States as the climate changes and weather becomes more extreme. And the answer is pretty surprising. In this episode, we look at many hazards from temperature, storms, drought, farming, wildfire, polar vortex, hurricanes, sea-level rise, crop failure, extreme heat, and even economics. We look at the effect of climate on future migration patterns in the US and talk to someone who left New York City after Hurricane Sandy and identifies as a climate migrant. She ended up moving to the safest county in the United States from a weather and climate perspective. We’ll reveal where she went and why.

Here is a link to the ProPublica article that was very influential in our research of this episode: https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/ (scroll to the bottom of the article for a list of counties and the criteria used to rate them)

Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.

LtGtIHe304s,What they DON'T tell you about Climate Change! ft.@ShriPrashant,"In this episode, we interviewed none other than Acharya Prashant, a renowned spiritual teacher, author, and advocate for conscious living, who brings unique perspective to pressing global topics. We dive deep into the concept of climate change, focusing on global warming and its devastating impacts. Carbon dioxide levels have surged to 419 million parts per million, leading to extreme weather conditions and the looming threat of runaway climate change. We discuss the primary culprits behind global warming, the role of capitalism in worsening the crisis, and why renewable energy isn't proving effective. The episode also highlights the staggering 41.6 billion tonnes of global carbon emissions and how 2024 has been recorded as the hottest year on record, with events like Log Angeles’ wildfires putting the environment at risk.

On a different note, we explore the ""Mujhe Farak Nahi Padta"" movement, the importance of self-retrospection, and Acharya Prashant’s experience in Rishikesh. We also talk about kid influencers and the risks of grooming, along with the rise of veganism and the counterarguments, especially with India being the largest exporter of beef. Finally, we discuss the challenges of environmental activism on social media and argue that the focus should shift from GDP to tangible work at the ground level.

Ro2yLb8ezUY,Does God Believe in Climate Change? | Gordon Wilson | Of Flames and Crowns Ep. 22,"In a world gripped by climate panic, environmentalism has become a new religion—and its doomsday prophets dominate the global stage. But is the threat as real as we're told, or is something deeper at play?

In this episode, Lennox Kalifungwa is joined by Dr. Gordon Wilson, Senior Fellow of Natural History at New Saint Andrews College and creator of The Riot and the Dance. Together they explore the theological roots of climate alarmism, the billion-dollar industry it fuels, and why biblical dominion offers a better way to love and steward the earth. Drawing from his book A Different Shade of Green, Dr. Wilson calls Christians to reject fear-based propaganda and recover a joyful, thankful, and faithful approach to creation.

He also contributes to the delivery of the Politics programme at the University, as well as continuing to work on the problems of sustainable mobility, active travel and its importance for social justice, in which capacity he contributes to a number of international networks. Prior to re-entering academia, I ran my own cycle business and was involved in a range of cycle campaigning and community organising projects, particularly linked with issues of social and environmental sustainability. My doctoral thesis (Liverpool, 2002) explored the links between Gandhian theory and practice, post-development and the political ecology of sustainability.

Since then I have taught in the Faculty of Social Science at the University of Chester specialising in the area of social change and sustainability and the impacts and processes of globalisation.

YKDYjXgdJmU,Is carbon capture a solution to the climate crisis?,"As a tool to address rising greenhouse gas emissions, carbon capture chemically removes carbon dioxide from the air, to store or recycle into products. The company behind a new plant to be opened this summer claims the facility will remove 500,000 tons of CO2 a year. But is this form of carbon capture – underwritten by the fossil fuel industry – an effective means to address climate change? Correspondent David Pogue looks at the technology behind this initiative, and the controversy it has raised.

wYUWBwzIfXY,Europe's rivers are running dry as the climate crisis worsens | DW News,"Much of Europe and the Northern Hemisphere is battling either wildfires, low water levels, harvest warnings, water use restrictions or a mixture of all these. In Germany, one core focus of the drought is the Rhine River, which ultimately connects the Alps with the North Sea. Europe's second-longest river after the Danube, it is also a core shipping lane for western Germany. It is still open to freight traffic for now, but already boats are unable to run fully laden. Germany's Federal Institute of Hydrology warned on Thursday that without rain, one notorious shallow point on the river could become completely impassable next week.

We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way. Our new channel Planet A explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means. We look at the big and the small: What we can do and how the system needs to change. Every Friday we'll take a truly global look at how to get us out of this mess.

m6ocwlt8xJ0,Are militaries driving the climate crisis? | The Stream,"For years, climate activists have centered their work around stopping some of the world’s biggest polluters — from fossil fuel companies, to the meat industry, to industrial farming. And while they remain some of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis, there’s a lesser known climate culprit that’s often forgotten: the military. 

Experts have pointed out that the US Department of Defense is the world’s single largest greenhouse gas emitter, with the US military referred to as  “one of the largest climate polluters in history.”  In fact, research suggests that if all of the world’s militaries were a country they’d be the fourth largest emitter across the globe. 

And beyond the emissions from humvees, warplanes, and tanks, modern warfare has a devastating effect on the planet. From bombing campaigns to drone strikes, warfare releases greenhouse gas emissions, compromises geodiversity, and can cause soil and air contamination.

In this episode of The Stream, we’ll look at the scale of military emissions, and whether a less militaristic society is not only good for people, but also for the planet. 

On this episode of The Stream, we speak with:

jQTc9284IkY,Why Carbon Emissions Matter in Real Estate  | Annu Talreja | Earth Day 2025,"Until recently, sustainability in real estate was vague — green patches, planted trees, and little accountability. But now?

📉 Carbon emissions are measurable.
🏗️ Real estate is facing pressure to clean up — globally and slowly in India too.
📊 ESG is no longer just a buzzword — it's becoming a business risk.

In this clip, Annu Talreja, Founder of Accacia.ai, breaks down how the industry mindset is shifting post-COVID, how Apple’s carbon-neutral goals are influencing global discourse, and why quantifiable sustainability is the future of real estate.

EbjKcHPmxKQ,What people get wrong about climate change,"When discussing climate change, it's not about saving the planet.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

One of the common mistakes people make about climate change is saying that it’s about “saving the planet.” But that’s not really the right way to think about it.

Earth has gone through immense climate changes many times before, in some cases leading to mass species extinction. Now, we’re living through the onset of human-caused climate change, and slowing it down isn’t about saving the Earth. It’s about saving ourselves. 

Humans have been around for just .004% of Earth’s history. And in all of human history – the 200,000 years since our species began – we’ve had agriculture for just 5% of that time and  electricity for .07% of that time. 

The simple truth about climate change is that it isn’t new to the planet, but civilization is. And with climate change we’re inviting a level of climate disruption that human civilization has simply never seen before.

Lyrics:
We’ll stop chopping down our trees!
Stop using plastic things!
We’ll carpool and drive EVs
And give back to the Earth we’ve been given

Cut down the milk and meat!
Green power the lights and heat!
We’ll sing this song on repeat
As we do our part for the world that we live in

Earth:
I’m Earth, the planet that you’re on, you know 
But I’m not feeling so well.
My temperature’s rising, species are dying,
Floods, droughts, and fires 
No longer surprising

I’m losing trees and my islands 
Slowly disappear
It’s getting harder and harder
To make a home for you here

Factory:
Hey Earth, let me break it down for ‘em:
We’re making those greenhouse gasses 
Trapping heat in the atmosphere
They come from cars and plastics
Cows and factories here.

We’re burning oil and coal
And all that natural gas
Releasing carbon dioxide and methane
And releasing them fast,
But hey, folks gotta live. Yea!

Earth: 
People need to live
But look at what you give
To the children after you
You need me - ooh
And I need you

Kid 1:
Hey! We’ll stop chopping down our trees
They absorb carbon dioxide

Kid 2:
We’ll switch over to EVs
Or carpool or go for a bike ride

Kid 3:
We’ll stop using plastic things
And take our own bags to the store

Kid 4:
Let’s change up the way we eat - a little less milk and meat

Cow:
*Burp*

Kid 5:
Let’s switch to renewable power 
unplug and take shorter showers
(But please don’t stop taking showers. That would be gross.)

Kids:
Stop chopping down our trees!
Stop using plastic things!
Carpool and drive EVs
And give back to the Earth we’ve been given

Cut down the milk and meat!
Green power the lights and heat!
And sing this song on repeat
As we do our part for the world that we live in

Kids:
“Grown-ups, take it away!”

Adults:
We can write our governments
And tell them to change 
They might say it’s impossible
But we can hold them responsible 

And help them to lead in
Cleaner energy
What we do now will reverberate
For centuries!

We’ll stop chopping down our trees!
Stop using plastic things!
We’ll carpool and drive EVs
And give back to the Earth we’ve been given

Cut down the milk and meat!
Green power the lights and heat!
We’ll sing this song on repeat
As we do our part for the world that we live in

(Repeat with EVERYBODY)

And we’ll start today!

Today, today, today, today

We’ll sing this song on repeat
As we do our part for the world that we live in
And we’ll start today

8Ukxv5-pwlg,The Science Behind Global Warming: The Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect,"This video gives an overview of the major factors involved in the warming of the earth as a result of increasing levels of greenhouse gases.
Timing of specific topics:
0:00 Intro: What are global warming, climate change, greenhouse gases, fossil fuels;  
3:15 Brief synopsis of how global warming occurs;  
5:30 Radiant energy, temperature, and outgoing infrared (IR) emission from the earth versus incoming solar energy;  
7:10 Understanding the earth energy balance (equilibrium) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and its relationship to the earth’s temperature; this section also introduces (9:35) the concept of albedo (amount of reflected solar energy);  
14:10 What is the meaning of the calculated earth surface temperature and its relationship to the actual surface temperature;  
15:55 Introduction to greenhouse gases;  
19:15 An explanation of heat and its relationship to temperature;  
21:05 What is the mechanism for greenhouse gases warming the earth: an explanation of how CO2 is able to absorb and generate infrared radiation, including CO2 vibrational frequencies and their connection to infrared frequencies;  
24:25 Significance of CO2’s interaction with infrared: the redistribution of infrared emitted by the earth;  25:55 Relevant features of the atmosphere, tying that back to CO2’s interaction with infrared;  27:15 What is emission height? Its significance to global warming: the consequences of changing emission height via increased CO2 concentration, and its relationship to the earth energy equilibrium;
32:40 An explanation of ‘radiative forcing’, the imbalance between earth’s emitted energy and absorbed solar energy;  
35:20 The role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas: the feedback mechanism between water vapor levels and the earth’s temperature, and the feedback between increasing CO2 levels and water vapor level;  
39:40 What is the specific mechanism for increasing the earth’s temperature;  
41:30 Why does the very tiny proportion of CO2 in the air have such a large impact on temperature?
 42:55 Why is a 1C temperature change so significant: a few examples of the effect of increasing temperature on climate.

He accused the Murdoch-owned Sun of supporting fracking and a reduction in taxes for fossil fuel companies.

More than 60 people have been arrested during protests by the climate activists outside two printing presses - which have led to a delay in some newspapers hitting stands.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel both called XR's actions ""completely unacceptable"".

uAU-1lSDTW8,Dawn Lippert: Community investment is the missing piece of climate action | TED Countdown,"There's been explosive investment in new technologies aimed at decarbonizing the planet. But climate investor Dawn Lippert says something key is missing from this strategy: investment in the local people these solutions would affect most. She shares how she's bridging the gap between investment in new tech and local communities -- by getting closer to the places where ideas are being put into action.

Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world. Get involved at https://countdown.ted.com/sign-up

f5NQM52J2jM,A micro-offset mindset: Who's on the climate crisis frontline? | Ed Crowther | TEDxBrayfordPool,"We are facing a huge environmental crisis with potential catastrophe in almost every direction. Humanity is both the cause and the solution. We know we need to act fast, but what if we were not the frontline defence? What if we had a different role? What if we use our resources and knowledge to equip nature, and let it do what it does best, while we do our best to keep out of the way and reduce our impact?

 Ed Crowther’s first job was on an organic farm, planting, picking and packing vegetables by hand. It sparked his lifelong interest in nature, the benefits it provides and how it’s all interconnected. In 2021 Ed started My Square Metre, an online platform allowing people and businesses to ‘Micro Offset’ elements of their environmental footprint through the creation of meadowland on degraded soil. Working with the University of Lincoln he is looking at ways to accelerate the re-wilding process in the UK’s rarest habitat (Wildflower Meadow) with the aim of planting 1km2 over the next 3 years.

_0TCrGtTEQM,How climate change makes hurricanes worse,"Here's what we know about climate change and hurricanes.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

We know that humanity's carbon footprint has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate, the context in which every weather event takes place. But trying to isolate the human influence from everything else that is going on can be really hard, especially for hurricanes, or what scientists call ""tropical cyclones.""

They're super complex and the quality of the historical data we have for them isn't great. We do have physics, though. Hurricanes are driven by the transfer of heat from the sea to the air through evaporation. The storm's maximum possible wind speed, or its potential intensity, depends in part on how warm the ocean is – and of course, we're warming the ocean.

So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet.

The hurricanes of the future will also be wetter. So coastal cities will face freshwater flooding from the sky paired with storm surge from the sea, which is higher now because we are also causing sea levels to rise. And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes. Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms have been increasing in The US and should continue to increase across the country. Even in places that might see less rain over the whole year, they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation.

This comes down to basic physics too: warmer air can take up more water before it dumps it back down on us. All of this means global warming worsens floods like the kind that hit Houston. 

But it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this. It depends on what we choose to do now. We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations to minimize the damage, but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions and shifting the world to clean energy, it's just going to get worse.

EXkbdELr4EQ,Climate change: the trouble with trees,"Tree-planting has been hailed as a solution to climate change. But how much can trees really do to tackle global warming? See our research here: https://econ.st/32HXvXY

Summer 2019 - More than 38,000 fires raged across the Amazon. Fires that were man-made. Over the past 50 years almost 17% of the world’s largest rainforest has been cleared. And globally deforestation has almost doubled in just five years.

Since the start of human civilisation it’s estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half. Clearing forests increases carbon-dioxide levels but planting them could store away some of the carbon already in the atmosphere.

This woman runs safaris in England. Guests are not only here to see wild animals - they’re here to see wild trees.

Almost 20 years ago Isabella Tree—yes that is her real name-handed 1,400 hectares of Sussex farmland back to nature, by doing, well nothing. She thinks this is the best way to use the land to help tackle climate change.

To stabilise the climate global carbon emissions need to drop to net zero by 2050. Simon Lewis is a professor of global change science.

And there’s never been more global ambition to plant trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square kilometres of forest by 2030 - an area slightly larger than India. The 2030 target looks likely to be met. But there’s a catch… 

Monoculture tree plantations like eucalyptus grow quickly but the trees are harvested every ten or so years releasing much of the carbon stored in the tree back into the atmosphere - which means that, according to some studies they’ll store only around one-fortieth of the carbon natural forests do over the long term.

In fact, those pledges to plant millions of trees actually promise to store 26bn tonnes less carbon than they could. Sometimes the motives for planting forests are less green than they might appear. By 2020 Ireland ought to have cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels. But at current rates it will have reduced them by only 5%. Planting forests might help Ireland avoid massive penalties for missing EU targets because the potential carbon these forests could store in the future can be counted as a carbon credit today. In the 1920s Ireland had the lowest forest cover in Europe at around 1%. That’s now risen to 11% and the government has set a target to cover 18% of the land with forest by 2046.

And now local community groups are protesting against these monoculture tree plantations. They say they’re doing more harm than good.

Tree-planting programmes invariably have an impact on the people living nearby. In east Africa one project is demonstrating what can be achieved
when there’s genuine buy-in from the local communities. Green Ethiopia is a mixed-tree planting charity.

The land is communally owned and co-operatives of local women receive benefits for planting trees which are protected from being harvested. Here conserving is just as important as planting. Green Ethiopia assesses whether the condition of the land is good enough to regenerate by itself. When it is—on about a third of the area the charity runs they leave it alone. Just like Isabella Tree, back in England.

Monoculture plantations are often preferred because they make money. So some experts are looking to a future where carbon payments could create financial incentives for natural forests. Ultimately though, the trouble with trees tackling climate change is space

In a bid to reach carbon neutrality by 2050,... South Korea has drastically raised its target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The new goal, announced Friday, seeks a 40 percent reduction by the end of this decade,... an increase from the previous goal of 26-point-3 percent.
Seo Eunkyung report.
South Korea has decided to substantially raise its carbon emissions reduction target for 2030… to speed up its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2050.
The presidential committee on carbon neutrality and related ministries announced on Friday that they have proposed to revise the nationally determined contribution goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels by 2030.
This is far more ambitious than the initial target of 26-point-three percent.
The nationally determined contribution or NDC, represents the action South Korea will take to help deliver on the global agreement to fight climate change.
South Korea uses 2018, the peak year of its gas emissions, as the benchmark year for setting the NDC goals.
The revised plan outlines reduction goals for each carbon-intensive industrial sector.
For the manufacturing sector which accounts for near 30 percent of the country's total industry and its heaviest emitter… the government pledges to scale down coal power generation, increase renewable energy production…and boost energy efficiency mainly through technology development and innovation. It also calls on the construction sector to increase the use of clean energy and the transportation industry to improve the supply of pollution-free vehicles.
The waste management sector is to reduce waste, increase recycling and expand the use of biodegradable bio-plastics.
South Korea will officially introduce its revised the reduction goal to the international community at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in November and submit a finalized government plan to the United Nations in December.

uI0uo6znYE4,"G20: Need for more Ambition and more Action  - UN Chief | Climate action | G20 Summit Rome, Italy","On the eve of COP26 in Glasgow, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, “all roads to success go through Rome,” and stressed that there is a “serious risk that Glasgow will not deliver.”

Speaking to reporters in Rome today (29 Oct) Guterres said several recent climate announcements might leave the impression of a “rosier picture. Unfortunately, this is an illusion.”

The UN chief said current Nationally Determined Contributions, which are formal commitments by governments, still condemn the world to a calamitous 2.7 degree increase. He added that even if recent pledges were clear and credible — and there are serious questions about some of them — the world is still careening towards climate catastrophe, with the best-case scenario producing a temperature rise well above a disastrous two degrees.

Guterres stressed the need for more ambition and more action, adding that this requires trust with is in short supply. Guterres noted the dangerous levels of mistrust among the big powers and appeal to the G20 for decisive steps to bridge what he called the trust gap.

Guterres highlighted the vaccine inequality and said, “I have long been pushing the G20 to lead a global vaccination plan to reach everyone, everywhere. That plan did not materialize — largely because of geo-political divides.” He added, “Global coordinated action has taken a backseat to vaccine hoarding and vaccine nationalism. People in the richest countries are getting third doses of vaccine, while only five per cent of Africans are fully vaccinated.”

The Secretary-General also highlighted the vast disparity in resources for pandemic recovery which is eroding trust. He said, “The recovery is amplifying inequalities. This is immoral. The IMF recently issued 650 billion USD in Special Drawing Rights. But this support largely goes to the countries that need them least since the SDRs are distributed according to quotas — an injustice in itself. That’s why I have been calling for a substantial — not symbolic — re-allocation of unused SDRs to vulnerable countries that need them, including middle-income countries. The G20 has a key role to guarantee it.”

Guterres urged the G20 to extend the Debt Service Suspension Initiative into next year and make it available to highly indebted vulnerable, including middle-income countries that request it. He underscored that countries should not be forced to choose between servicing their debt or serving their people.

The UN chief said trust was also being undermined by a lack of climate ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance. He said concrete action was required now to reduce global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, added that G20 countries have a particular responsibility to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive, as they represent around 80 per cent of emissions.

He said, “According to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in light of national circumstances, developed countries must lead the effort. But given the present situation, emerging economies, too, must go the extra mile to achieve effective global emissions reductions in this decade. We need maximum ambition, from all countries on all fronts.”
Guterres also called on donors to allocate at least half of their climate finance towards adaptation and resilience, adding that ambition on climate finance includes making good on the commitment to provide 100 billion USD each year to developing countries.

He welcomed efforts led by Canada and Germany to help achieve this, but said the first step
delays the largest support for years, without clear guarantees.

He said, “Unfortunately, the message to developing countries is essentially this: The check is in the mail. On all our climate goals, we have miles to go. And we must pick up the pace. Scientists are clear on the facts. Leaders must be as clear in their actions. Glasgow can be a turning point towards a safer, greener world for our children and grandchildren. It is not too late. But we must act now.”

Guterres urged the G20 to show the solidarity that people want and the world desperately needs, which begins by rebuilding trust and credibility among their members.

Responding to questions, Guterres said the world would get nowhere if developed and developing countries blame each other. He said, “This is the moment for everyone to do the maximum - developed countries must do more and the emerging economies must also do more instead of creating a scenario of blaming each other. That is why this G20 is an opportunity to rebuild trust and for all to do their best.”

UmIJCGQzCiU,Conversation with global warming skeptic Anthony Watts,"Spencer Michels interviews one of the nations's most read climate skeptics Anthony Watts.  Watts believes much of the data used to support global warming theories is faulty.  The big problem, as Watts sees it, is that the stations were temperatures are gathered are too close to urban developments where heat is soaked up and distorts the readings. So it looks like the earth is warming though it may not be.

YOJ2Mf6KQ3g,"Does ""Every Little Thing"" REALLY Stop Climate Change?","Recycling, planting trees, and going vegan are just a handful of the many ways to reduce our carbon footprint. Companies and countries do it too, performing small individual tasks anywhere at any time to “save the planet.” But these small actions have little impact when compared to the vast polluting and emissions-intensive systems that underpin modern society. In this episode, join Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant to explore how making individuals fully responsible for reducing emissions can be counterproductive to combat climate change.

Based on the Jenny Price book, ""Stop Saving the Planet!""

Rather, as this webinar will seek to explain, transformational changes, both at global and sectoral levels, are necessary to achieve the LTTG.

-Q0xUXo2zEY,Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot make short film on the climate crisis,"Environmental activists Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have helped produce a short film highlighting the need to protect, restore and use nature to tackle the climate crisis. Living ecosystems like forests, mangroves, swamps and seabeds can pull enormous quantities of carbon from the air and store them safely, but natural climate solutions currently receive only 2% of the funding spent on cutting emissions. The film’s director, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: 'We tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George’s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.'

Have you heard of our simple solution that tackles poverty & the effects of the climate crisis?
The solution? Growing trees! 
Trees help land to stay fertile so people can grow food. 
Trees protect our planet, absorbing carbon dioxide - a cause of the climate crisis. 
Every year, Tree Aid grows millions of trees, but we don’t just plant and walk away. 
We make sure local people have the training and tools to make each tree thrive. 

HOW WE WORK
Our work is led by local people with local knowledge and expertise. We equip people with the tools and skills they need to grow trees, protect their land, and start viable businesses. This provides food and an income, tackling poverty today. It also pushes for long-term change, improving the environment for tomorrow. 

We learn what works and share it – locally, nationally, and internationally. Together with local communities, we influence policy and push for change that protects trees, people, and our planet. Every tree we grow or protect is helping to challenge the effects of the climate crisis and tackle hunger and poverty.

RESTORING THE ENVIRONMENT
We grow trees to protect the environment. We support people to use trees to improve the fertility of the soil and sustainably manage land in a way that helps them deal with the effects of the climate crisis.

PROTECTING FORESTS & LAND
We grow trees for long-term change. We campaign for forests to be managed by the people who depend on them. We work with communities and local government so they can agree rules for using forests and their resources.

BUILDING SUSTAINABLE BUSINESSES 
We grow trees which grow businesses. We support communities to make and sell tree products, like shea butter and soap. The income they make from their businesses pays for essential healthcare and education.

GROWING NUTRITIOUS FOOD 
We grow trees for healthy food, all year round. Trees provide nutritious fruit, nuts and leaves, giving people stable supplies of food even when other crops fail.",2021-03-12T11:51:01Z,UCg1_-XKLA29uGVLfxEePpcQ,Tree Aid,"['tree aid', 'great green wall']",77728,19,3,PT35S,29,none,732,64,432533

45rKKw3m-5w,Using Space for Climate Action - UK Space Agency,"We, the UK Space Agency, provide technical advice on government’s National Space Strategy, and guide the UK space sector to deliver government’s vision.

We design and deliver programmes that implement government’s Space Strategy, including as a sponsor of national capabilities and an early-stage investor in space research and development. We promote the UK space sector’s interests and achievements, make connections to join up industry and academia, and represent the UK in international space programmes.

The UK Space Agency’s work on COP26 is guided by the National Space Strategy which sets the strategic direction of our work on climate. Goal 5 of the NSS commits HMG to “Use space to deliver for UK citizens and the world”. In alignment with this goal, our COP26 work package sets out a broad range of initiatives that seeks to deliver against this goals by supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation both for the UK as well as globally by using our world-leading scientific and private sector expertise.  

To deliver this role, for climate, the UK space sector and the government’s vision, we draw on our deep expertise in space science, technology, and the global space landscape, our core Civil Service skills, and our partnerships across government, the sector, and with space institutions around the world.


The UK funds 33% of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA’s Compass Initiative) which is based in Harwell, Oxfordshire. The science and research from this programme and others underpins the IPCC assessment reports and is a major evidence for how the planet is changing.

About Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey:
Hosted by renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, COSMOS will explore how we discovered the laws of nature and found our coordinates in space and time. It will bring to life never-before-told stories of the heroic quest for knowledge and transport viewers to new worlds and across the universe for a vision of the cosmos on the grandest scale. COSMOS will invent new modes of scientific storytelling to reveal the grandeur of the universe and re-invent celebrated elements of the legendary original series, including the Cosmic Calendar and the Ship of the Imagination. The most profound scientific concepts will be presented with stunning clarity, uniting skepticism and wonder, and weaving rigorous science with the emotional and spiritual into a transcendent experience.

Phv8hfA1tOg,Earth’s Constant Thrum Tied to Climate Change | WION Podcast,"A new study reveals that climate change is causing Earth to shake—not from earthquakes, but from powerful ocean waves. Published in Nature Communications, the research shows that rising sea swell and stormy conditions are generating seismic waves detected globally. Using data from 52 seismographs, scientists observed a steady rise in wave energy since the late 1980s. These waves produce a constant tremor, signaling the growing impact of global warming on our planet’s natural systems. Learn how climate-driven seas are sending shockwaves through the Earth.

k1oPVp63eNk,The state of the climate crisis | Climate Action Tracker,"Take action on climate change at http://countdown.ted.com.

With the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 197 countries agreed to set emission targets that would limit global temperature rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by capping greenhouse emissions at ""net-zero"" -- or absorbing as much carbon as they emit -- by 2050. So far, only two countries (Gambia and Morocco) are hitting their targets, while the biggest emitters are falling flat, or ignoring their goals entirely. How can we hold these countries accountable? Enter the Climate Action Tracker.

छात्रों के लिए अंग्रेजी में ग्लोबल वार्मिंग पर निबंध!
हमारा ग्रह पृथ्वी वनस्पतियों और जीवों की असंख्य प्रजातियों का घर है, लेकिन इन सबसे बढ़कर, यह सबसे बुद्धिमान और विनाशकारी प्रजातियों में से एक का घर है, जो हम, मनुष्य हैं। जितना हम दुनिया में कमज़ोरों का उपयोग और सुरक्षा करने के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं, उतना ही हम दुनिया को अपूरणीय क्षति भी पहुँचा रहे हैं। कई जलवायु वैज्ञानिकों का मानना ​​है कि ग्रीनहाउस गैस उत्सर्जन में महत्वपूर्ण कमी के बिना, 21वीं सदी में तापमान में 3 से 8 डिग्री की वृद्धि होगी, जलवायु पैटर्न में भारी बदलाव आएगा, बर्फ की चादरें ढह जाएँगी और समुद्र कई फीट ऊपर उठ जाएँगे। 

किसी अन्य विश्व युद्ध, एक विशाल क्षुद्रग्रह, एक घातक महामारी या ग्लोबल वार्मिंग के संभावित अपवाद के साथ, हमारे ग्रह के लिए एकमात्र खतरा हो सकता है। वायुमंडल में कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड, मीथेन और नाइट्रस ऑक्साइड जैसी ग्रीनहाउस गैसों का उत्सर्जन ग्लोबल वार्मिंग का प्राथमिक चालक है। बिजली संयंत्र कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड के प्राथमिक जनरेटर हैं।

1:17:31 - समापन और धन्यवाद

विवरण: 
आचार्य जी ने 2025 को मानव इतिहास का सबसे खतरनाक साल बताया क्योंकि climate change के संकेत अब नियंत्रण से बाहर हो चुके हैं। Paris Agreement (2015) में 2030 तक carbon emissions 45% कम करने और 2050 तक net zero का लक्ष्य तय किया गया था। परंतु आज emissions न केवल बढ़ रहे हैं, बल्कि feedback cycles जैसे Arctic ice melting, permafrost और peatlands से carbon और methane का रिसाव, और जंगलों का Carbon Source बनना स्थिति को बदतर बना रहे हैं।

 Global warming के कारण धरती का temperature बढ़ रहा है, जिससे natural disasters और livelihood challenges का खतरा है। नेता और जनता इस सच को ignore कर रहे हैं। आचार्य जी ने समस्या का only solution आध्यात्मिकता में बताया, जहाँ मनुष्य अपने self-interest को त्याग कर nature और आने वाली पीढ़ियों के लिए sensitive बने।उन्होंने कहा कि साहस और जागरूकता के बिना बदलाव असंभव है।

At least three people have died after working in triple-digit heat, just as Republican Governor Greg Abbott signs into law a new measure that overrides mandatory water breaks for workers. Meanwhile, 32 people have been reported to have died in Texas prisons, most of which lack air conditioning and are prone to increased rates of heat-induced cardiac events. We are joined on Democracy Now! by Steven Monacelli in Dallas, who is _The Texas Observer's_ special investigative correspondent. His recent piece is headlined ""Texans Die from Heat After Governor Bans Mandatory Water Breaks.""

s0Rf4gJlmHg,The Age of the Climate Crisis | Aryan Ranjan | TEDxAmericanHeritageSchool,"It seems ironic to Aryan Ranjan that we live in a country where more people would rather get weather predictions from a groundhog than actually listen to climate change evidence from scientists. Yet, when we see our sea levels rising, when we see our hurricanes getting stronger, and when we see places getting flooded that have never been flooded before, we turn a blind eye. We turn a blind eye to the very problem that we have created - not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as human beings. 
 
Unfortunately, the phrase “climate change” in and of itself has taken on a very negative connotation over the years. In fact, if you even mention the words “climate change” to anybody, it will almost always result in a heated debate. Aryan has tried. He says, ""The cold hard truth is that the phrase 'climate change' has become a trigger word for both sides of the political spectrum to a point that people don’t even feel comfortable talking about it anymore."" But that begs the question: Why? Why is it that we always have to take politics into account for everything? Does the thermometer give us a different temperature depending on whether we are Democrats or Republicans? Of course not! One hundred degrees is going to be 100 degrees across the board. Yet, that’s how we view things in modern society. But the real question is: Will we ever find a solution to climate change? At the rate we’re going, the simple answer is no. Because every time we take a step toward coming up with a solution for climate change, we actually end up taking four steps backward. And the media doesn’t make it any better. Based on the media, it seems as if there is no hope left. But, in Aryan's talk, he will tell you that climate change breakthroughs exist, and even more importantly, he says we have a decent shot to end this climate crisis.  Aryan believes through education and adherence to climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect our planet. He is a member of Citizens Climate Lobby, a non-profit, non-partisan, grassroots advocacy organization dedicated to lobbying for national legislation for climate solutions. Through this organization, Aryan has been able to meet with local elected officials to discuss climate solutions. He is also Founder and President of the Climate Change club at American Heritage, which empowers other high schoolers at AHS by giving them the chance to discuss concerns and solutions regarding climate change. Additionally, Aryan is Captain of the Junior High Congressional Debate team, Treasurer of the Mu Alpha Theta Honor Society, Officer of Model United Nations, and a member of Congressman Ted Deutch’s Congressional Youth Cabinet. Aryan is honored to give a TED Talk and hopes he is able to influence more youth to get involved with climate action. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

[Letras de ""Global Warming"" ft. Pitbull]

[Intro: Pitbull]
Up in this a new million
You heard me, Sensato
It's Mr. Worldwide
Y El mundo es el patio
Let my dreams y'all dormant
Category Sixes are storming
Take this as a, take this a warning
Welcome to, welcome to global warming

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm tired of this rap shit cause all they do is rap shit
About coke shit, crack shit, click clack shit
But they never sold coke or click clack shit
That's why I'm laughing to the bank, ha-ha bitch
Private jets, I'm on that mile high shit
Without Denver, I'm going to November
Earth, wind, fire, I'm all for September
George Lopez put all, you remember
Non-stop about bankers and lenders
Fuck these fake sugar ass niggas splendor
I see your game, your plan, your agenda
They'll push your shit way back to Nintendo
No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
I do it for the paper, I'm a business man

[Chorus: Pitbull]
If you get it, that's cool
It's all about the billionaires, baby
Welcome to the new school

[Verse 2: Sensato]
A billi A billi, al banco voy abrile
Una cuenta pa meterle mile y mile y matarile
I get's money en mi bloque hay misiles
Hay que comprar leche Milex y zapatos piel reptiles
Its all about them billionaires
I'm so fucking serious
Look at all them zeros
They looking like Cheerios
Monthly like her period
Y'all niggas gotta hurry up
My team is in your area
regando la epidemia
Tengo una novia albanian
blanquita macadamia
toy enfermo leukemia
your pockets got anemia
soo 
If you get it, that's cool
It's all about them billionaires baby
Welcome to the new school

#globalwarming #greenhouseeffect #workingmodel #workingproject #sciencefair #howtofunda #climatechange #climateimpact 
Simple Explanation :

Global warming is like Earth catching a fever due to too much heat-trapping pollution. Imagine our planet with a cozy blanket, but when we burn fossil fuels like coal and oil, it adds extra layers, trapping too much heat. 
This extra warmth causes problems like melting ice, rising seas, and weird weather. It's like our planet feeling under the weather. 
To help, we need to use cleaner energy, like sunshine and wind, and be mindful of our actions. 
By reducing this pollution, we can cool down Earth and keep it healthy for us and the amazing diversity of life it hosts.

Understanding these emissions categories is key to tackling your facility's carbon footprint, yet they’re often explained in ways that overcomplicate the basics. 🌱

 So, let’s break down Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions:

 🏭Scope 1: Direct emissions from your operations (think fuel combustion on-site).
💡 Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the energy your facility purchases, like electricity.
📦 Scope 3: Everything else upstream and downstream of your operations, across your value chain, from supplier emissions to product use and disposal.

These categories are ways of classifying where your facility's carbon emissions came from. And with regulations requiring detailed reporting in each category, understanding the difference is critical for both compliance and impact reduction.

♻️Plus, this is how you can uncover the largest opportunities to reduce your GHG emissions. 

➡️Ready to uncover these opportunities? Drop a water ""💧"" emoji in the comments and we’ll send you our decarbonization eBook to help you get started!

TVQm5lTRMO0,Climate change or politics? - Why Madagascar is going hungry | DW Documentary,"There’s been no proper rainfall in southern Madagascar for seven years. The ground is arid, people are suffering from hunger and thirst. The UN says this is the first hunger crisis directly caused by climate change. But is that really the case?

There’s been no water in the Manambovo river for several months. Locals dig at the sandy riverbed in the hope they’ll find a few drops of water. The government blames the long dry spell on climate change and the UN agrees that this is the main reason for the worsening crisis. But critical voices say the government shares some of the responsibility — despite years of western aid, southern Madagascar is stuck in a rut, with few tarmac roads, hardly any schools and an extremely high birth rate. DW journalist Adrian Kriesch reports on the measures needed right now, as well as the importance of the imminent rainy season.

N-PNlUkgfMs,Bill McKibben: Climate Crisis Needs Urgent Action as Earth Records Hottest Temps Ever,"This week unprecedented temperatures driven by climate change shattered heat records around the world. More records could be broken soon, as scientists say 2023 is set to be one of the warmest years in the history of planet Earth. ""We can't stop global warming at this point,"" says Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org. ""All we can do is try to stop it short of the place where it cuts civilizations off at the knees."" McKibben says these temperatures are the ""inevitable result"" of fossil fuel use, criticizes politicians for their simultaneous embrace of renewable energy and fossil fuels, and calls on activists to disrupt the status quo: ""This is the last of these moments we're going to have when the world is summoned to action by events and when there's still time to make at least some difference in the question of how hot it ultimately gets.""

Using Vienna, Austria's gender-equal urban planning program as a model for how women can be included in every step of building a green economy, Sqalli offers solutions for advancing both sustainability and gender equality – at the same time.

Jsi5Vp_6tdE,UN Chief on Climate Change and his vision for the 2019 Climate Change Summit,"In a landmark speech today (10 Sep) United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said, “Climate change is the defining issue of our time – and we are at a defining moment,” adding that “if we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us.”

Speaking at UN Headquarters in New York, the Secretary-General said “scientists have been telling us for decades. Over and over again. And far too many leaders have refused to listen. And far too few have acted with the vision the science demands.”

He said noted that “as climate change intensifies, we will find it harder to feed ourselves” causing “more and more people will be forced to migrate from their homes as the land they depend on becomes less able to support them.” He added that “this is already leading to local conflicts over dwindling resources.”

Guterres called on governments, businesses, scientists and that will put the planet on a path to a better future. 

He said “the commitments made so far by Parties to the Paris Agreement represent just one-third of what is needed. The mountain in front of us is very high. But it is not insurmountable. We know how to scale it. Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.”

Guterres also outlined his vision for a new Climate Summit in 2019, which he will be convening to rally the international community, to step up action in key areas inclusive sustainable energy production, economic growth, green investment and better stewardship of natural resources.

He said, “enormous benefits await humankind if we can rise to the climate challenge” and added that the argument that tackling climate change is expensive and could harm economic growth “is hogwash.” In fact, he said “the opposite is true.”

The call for greater ambition on climate action comes amid record temperature rises and extreme weather events across the globe. The last few months alone saw devastating floods in southern India, wildfires in the United States and extreme heatwaves in Japan.

Guterres said, “we stand at an existential crossroad. If we are to take the right path – the only sensible path -- we will have to muster the full force of human ingenuity” and stressed that “technology is on our side in the battle to address climate change.”

He pointed out that “the transition to a cleaner, greener future needs to speed up” and said that infrastructure investment must be “sustainable or we will lock in a high-polluting dangerous future.”

Guterres said “every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants -- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth. Our fate is in our own hands. The world is counting on all of us to rise to the challenge before it’s too late.”

When world leaders signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, they pledged to stop temperatures rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees, as possible. But scientists and a major UN study, indicate that the target is already well off-track. 

The UN chief’s message also comes ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, to be held on the west coast of the United States, in San Francisco, from 12-14 September. National, regional and municipal leaders will gather with business people and philanthropic communities to underscore their commitment to climate action.",2018-09-10T23:02:05Z,UC5O114-PQNYkurlTg6hekZw,United Nations,"['UN', 'United Nations', 'Climate change']",41257,575,213,PT28M2S,25,none,3100000,18742,456819284
HFFlDLdWTg4,Green Riders: The Screen Industry Takes Action on the Climate Crisis,"The Equity-backed Green Rider campaign shares how actors and producers can drive the fight for a safe planet.

The LA fires have brought the climate crisis right into the iconic home of the entertainment industry. So, what now? What if TV & film could set the standard for how we respond to climate disasters? The actor-led Green Rider campaign is doing just that, empowering screen workers to transform long-standing traditions of wasteful consumption into pioneering levels of sustainability.

At its core, the Green Rider is a union-backed contract addition that sets out an actor’s commitment to green practices and fair sharing of resources. It opens collaboration with productions, supercharging the push for TV & Film sets to be cleaner and greener. Led by passionate “actor-vists” and supported by talent like Benedict Cumberbatch and Gemma Arterton, the Green Rider flips the script on star culture: encouraging talent to use their influence not for consumption, but climate action.

At The Conduit, we’ll discuss with a panel of actors and creatives how this groundbreaking initiative can reshape the entertainment industry and inspire global change, envisioning a future where creativity and sustainability go hand in hand.",2025-04-24T07:50:57Z,UC8BcgQvn81qbbidcsEuXnAA,The Conduit,[],27,3,0,PT1H34M24S,24,none,7740,503,552219

""It’s been called the Great Resignation, as millions of workers opt out of degrading or potentially dangerous work under the shadow of Covid-19. But for the youngest segment of the workforce, it’s hardly a choice at all. In September, almost a full quarter of Americans ages 20 to 34 were not working or on the job hunt.

This should come as no surprise given the current job market and the fact that young people continue to suffer under the conditions of 21st-century capitalism, where college degrees are exchanged for unpaid internships and union membership remains anemic. What is surprising, however, is how the putative party of young people in Washington has responded—with a great resignation of its own.""

He's secured more money for renewable energy and proposed tougher regulations on carbon and methane emissions. But it's been a more complicated story when it comes to drilling for oil and gas. William Brangham has a look at how that's playing out.

GNwoLw0Gu64,What if Climate Change Was a Hoax? | Frankly 72,"(Recorded September 22, 2024)

14.8% of Americans do not believe in climate change. Recently, a study mapping a 485-million-year history of Earth’s temperature and CO2 levels has been misinterpreted by some who downplay urgent climate concerns. Their argument suggests that, since the Earth has experienced much higher temperatures and CO2 concentrations in the past, the current rise of a few degrees won’t significantly affect us - and that climate concerns are being over exaggerated

What if climate change was, in fact, a “hoax”? What if all of the climate science developed in recent decades was a fraud? Could we then just generally exhale and continue humanity's current economic trajectory unimpeded?

Exploring these questions in today’s Frankly, Nate emphasizes the limited, ‘narrow boundary’ perspective of downplaying the urgency of climate change. A more nuanced understanding of ecology reveals that the long-term stability of our planet depends on numerous environmental tipping points, with climate change being just one of them. Even if climate change was a “hoax”, we are still causing accelerating harm to the life support systems of Earth , pushing the biosphere beyond its limits in a way which will profoundly impact our future, even our near term future.

In a new film, alumni Sir David Attenborough and Dr Jane Goodall DBE, and leading Cambridge University researchers, talk about the urgency of the climate crisis – and some of the solutions that will take us towards zero carbon.
 
If we are to avoid climate disaster we must sharply reduce our carbon dioxide emissions starting today – but how? Cambridge researchers describe their work on generating and storing renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, understanding the impact of climate policies, and probing how we can each reduce our environmental impact. We hear how the ambitious new programme Cambridge Zero is bringing together ideas and innovations to tackle the global challenge of climate catastrophe – and inspiring a generation of future leaders – and how the University is looking at its own operations to develop a zero carbon pathway for the future.

uONrQmWxAN0,Financing the Race to Zero - Exponential Climate Action Summit II,"Join the dialogue on https://www.wedonthavetime.org/ ​ and follow our speakers on the world's largest social network for climate action.

Finance is about to undergo a major transformation in the next decade as capital needs to be reallocated to stabilize Earth’s climate. How close are we to a tipping point in the finance sector? How fast will the transformation unfold? What will happen next?

More information about the summit https://wedonthavetime.org/earthday

Our societies need to halve CO2 emissions by 2030 and continue toward zero by 2050, by scaling climate solutions exponentially. Capital must enable the exponential transformation and the financial sector must be exponentially transformed

At our second Exponential Climate Action Summit we bring together transformers, disruptors and enablers focusing on how to finance The Race to Zero. Join us.

nOb6eEuANcs,100% Renewable diesel cars could reduce carbon emissions while waiting for electric vehicles,"Working with General Motors, University of Michigan mechanical engineers put together a renewable diesel vehicle demonstration: https://rddemo.engin.umich.edu/ Using 100% renewable hydrocarbon biofuels, engineers estimate that there could be an 80% reduction in the carbon footprint over the use of traditional, petroleum-sourced fuels. Both a Chevy Cruze diesel and GMC Sierra Pickup diesel are being used in this demonstration.

While the move from petroleum fuels to biofuels is not as environmentally drastic as a complete transition from diesel to electric motor power, switching to vehicles run with biofuels could be a more immediate solution. Even though it is estimated that half of new cars sold will be electric in the year 2030, it will still take many more years after to make a significant dent in greenhouse gas emissions. The transition from gasoline to biofuels could occur while electric vehicle technology is further developed and institutionalized.

The renewable diesel fuel used in the demonstration consists of bio-derived hydrocarbons from plant oils and animal fats. Because this carbon comes from within the biogenic carbon cycle, it would add much less carbon to the atmosphere than traditional diesel fuel.

This research was led by André Boehman, a Professor at University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering and Director of the W.E. Lay Automotive Laboratory.

nWxly5ej25M,"Corporate Carbon Footprint - Understanding Scope 1, 2 and 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions","What's included a company's carbon footprint? How to measure corporate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions? Every business leader should know what to consider as part of their company footprint, this video explains what's included.

Often we tend to think about facilities, energy use, and perhaps the fleet - but these account only for a part of a company’s total carbon footprint. The Sustainability Speaker Susanna Hasenoehrl helps you to better understand this, walking you through the concept of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.  

Scope 1 and 2 emissions arise from a company’s operational activities, such as a production facility, or heating or cooling an office. These can be controlled somewhat easily - for example, by switching to renewable energy, or to an electric fleet.

So what about Scope 3? Pukka, a Unilever brand, reports that 49% of their emissions come from boiling the kettle, to make a 'cuppa'. This is an example of Scope 3 emissions, which are more indirect - yet related to the usage of a company’s products and services. 

For most companies, Scope 3 makes up most of their carbon footprint. Scope 3 emissions can be quite difficult to measure, as it includes things like emissions from waste - when a product is disposed of - the supply chain, outsourced activities, and even business travel.

Nonetheless: when you come across a company’s carbon disclosure, do ask whether Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are included.",2021-04-05T12:02:06Z,UCCZmzY8yfU6odz40gC-6CoA,The Sustainability Speaker - Susanna Hasenoehrl,[],64269,487,16,PT2M1S,22,none,747,1,64266

kABavlnW7pQ,We’re Trying to Solve the Climate Crisis at the Wrong Scale | Eric Sauder | TEDxLancaster,"We can reverse climate change, but the solutions must first take root locally. In his talk, climate strategist Eric Sauder shares a vision for how meaningful progress can be made by building allies across rural and urban communities. He describes how this regional strategy can diffuse political challenges and engage neighbors to build a more resilient future.   Eric Sauder is a social innovator focused on climate change with a background in engineering, sustainability, and design. Despite the looming challenge of climate change, Eric is resolutely optimistic about the potential for people to implement solutions that build a more vibrant and equitable world. For the past five years, he has worked alongside farmers and natural resource professionals to create new programs and support for farmers to sequester carbon, generate ecosystem services, and create resilient agricultural economies. This vantage point allowed Eric to see the potential for greater regional climate collaboration. He founded RegenAll, a Lancaster, PA based nonprofit, to catalyze regeneration across rural and urban communities. RegenAll works with households, businesses, and communities to identify and implement place-based climate solutions that capitalize on a region’s unique strengths and resources. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

How do we know what our carbon emissions are? Where does carbon emission data come from? In this video I talk to the European Space Agency’s climate office about how they use satellites to monitor carbon emissions from space, and how satellites can improve how we estimate carbon emissions on the ground.

Eco warrior slammed as ‘hypocrite’ after blue origin space mission. Climate experts suggest Katy & crew's 11-minute space ride released tons of greenhouse gases. Experts say that Jeff Bezos' space rocket virtually released no direct carbon dioxide. However, water vapour released as byproduct is still an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas, argue scientists. The harmful impact of the short space mission stands in contrast to Katy's advocacy for environment. The singer did a weather report in 2015 for UNICEF, warning against man-made climate changes.

RFjAjO0dl3M,Militaries are fuelling the climate crisis | All Hail The Planet,"The impact of war is so much more than just the emissions from tanks, ships and warplanes - modern warfare has a devastating effect on people and the planet. 

So, what is the scale of planetary destruction wrought by militaries? And in a world where nations justify war on the basis of supposed ‘security’ benefits - isn’t the harm to the earth not also a huge threat to our collective security?

Join Ali Rae in this sixth episode of #AllHailThePlanet - a 10 part series delving into the social, economic and political forces undermining meaningful global action on climate change.

In this episode, Ali speaks with Author & Researcher at the Transnational Institute (TNI), Nick Buxton; Author & Associate Professor of International Relations at Georgetown University, Marwa Daoudy; and Political Scientist & Co-director of Brown University’s ‘Costs of War’ project, Neta Crawford.

p5BouKMNgo8,Klima-Podcast: Climate Action – Child Protection | On the move | SOS-Kinderdörfer weltweit,"In der Klimadebatte ist Migration und Flucht eines der meistdiskutierten Themen. Doch warum werden Menschen eigentlich gezwungen, ihre Heimat zu verlassen? Welche Rolle spielt die Klimakrise? Und was sind andere Fluchtfaktoren?  

Das erfahrt ihr in der 3. Folge unseres Podcasts ""Climate Action – Child Protection"". In dieser Folge sprechen wir mit Dr. Deqa Dimbil. Sie arbeitet seit acht Jahren für die SOS-Kinderdörfer, derzeit ist sie in Mogadischu Regionalberaterin für Ost- und Südafrika für Krisenbewältigung und humanitäre Hilfe am Horn von Afrika. Als studierte Ärztin hat sie die teils schlimmen (Gesundheits-)Folgen der Klimakrise gesehen, unter denen die Menschen in der Region leiden. 

Dr. Deqa Dimbil berichtet von der harten Realität in Geflüchtetencamps und erzählt, warum es eben nicht nur “das Klima” ist, das Menschen zur Flucht zwingt – sondern Faktoren, die von der Klimakrise beeinflusst werden. Wir blicken hinter die “großen Erzählungen” der Klimamigration und sprechen auch über die Verantwortung der Industrienationen.  

Das alles erfahrt ihr in unserer dritten Podcastfolge von “Climate Action – Child Protection”!

u9KxE4Kv9A8,Greta Thunberg (Young Climate Activist) at the Climate Action Summit 2019 - Official Video,"Greta Thunberg, Young Climate Activist, at the Opening of the Climate Action Summit 2019.

Global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3°C since 1990. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying, and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security.

The impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere and are having very real consequences on people’s lives. Climate change is disrupting national economies, costing us dearly today and even more tomorrow. But there is a growing recognition that affordable, scalable solutions are available now that will enable us all to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies.

The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C and even, as asked by the latest science, to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

Thankfully, we have the Paris Agreement – a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres is calling on all leaders to come to New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.",2019-09-23T15:45:37Z,UC5O114-PQNYkurlTg6hekZw,United Nations,"['dpiavl', 'english', 'global issues', 'topics/issues', 'cas', 'cas2019', 'climate change', '6088742229001']",1676681,14804,5464,PT4M8S,25,none,3100000,18742,456819284

EplcPK4E7Zk,Climate Change Solutions with Neil deGrasse Tyson & Katharine Hayhoe,"What solutions exist to fix climate change? On this Earth Day, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice answer questions about real-world climate solutions and aspects of climate change you might not be thinking about, with atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe, PhD. 

Is it all industry’s fault? Is there a way to make money while cleaning things up? Learn about government subsidies on fossil fuels, climate pricing, and direct versus indirect impacts of climate change. How do we subsidize fossil fuels? What’s the difference between dramatic climate change in the past and what is happening now? Find out what paleoclimatologists think. 

How much do humans contribute to the planet’s warming? What do we do to get all this carbon out of the atmosphere? We discuss carbon capture as a solution, creating a carbon neutral fuel source for airplanes, and algae that create biofuel. How much are fuel companies helping fight greenhouse gas emissions and how much of it is just greenwashing? How do we get climate change deniers to shift their lifestyles? We take a look at climate action and some of the messaging that needs to change. 

Hear about Katharine’s book “Saving Us'' and more questions from our patrons. How do we get factory farming to evolve to combat climate change? We break down Thomas Malphus’s Theory that population would outstrip food supply and why it is not happening to us. Are people hungry because of food shortage or because of some other reason? We discuss distribution networks and reengineering agriculture. What is the future of nuclear power? Are we going to get nuclear fusion? Does progress for developing nations mean even more pollution? We explore the entanglement between colonialism and fossil fuels and our steps forward after the IPCC report.

In this climate change video essay I talk about the good news about climate change, and how we are facing up to the climate crisis. Our action on climate so far is not enough, but that is no reason to ignore the progress made on climate to date. If you like videos from Just Have A Think or Our World In Data or Climate Town you'll enjoy this short video essay about climate optimism.

@EasylearningArt 

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

9Yyt9m53e6Q,The Future Of: Climate Action,"The Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celcius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, came into force three years ago. Since then, there have been some doubts as to whether this target can be achieved and, in response, a global youth movement has emerged to demand more action.

In this episode, Professor Greg Morrison, from the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, gives Jess and David an overview of the current state of climate action and the role scientists are playing to ‘save the world’.

tlWuP7wESZw,Ilissa Ocko: The fastest way to slow climate change now | TED Countdown,"""Cutting methane is the single fastest, most effective opportunity to reduce climate change risks in the near term,"" says atmospheric scientist Ilissa Ocko. That's because, unlike carbon dioxide, methane's warming power doesn't come from a gradual buildup over time but is almost entirely from recent emissions. Ocko identifies three main sources of methane pollution which, if addressed, could dramatically slow down the rate of global warming within years -- not decades. ""This is the methane moment,"" Ocko says.

Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world. Get involved at https://countdown.ted.com/sign-up

This significant event was attended by experts from various fields, representatives of the academic community, mass media, civil society, as well as delegations of volunteers of ALLATRA and the Creative Society project from more than 35 countries.

◼️ Main topics of the meeting:
🌐 Exponential growth of climate disasters and joint search for solutions to this problem with the support of the UN in combating rapid climate change
🌐 Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms
🌐 Threat to democracy

During his visit to the European Union, Dr. Egon Cholakian, a lecturer in the field of intelligence and an expert on national security, attended the global meeting of ALLATRA International Public Movement participants. In his speech, Dr. Cholakian announced that he would represent ALLATRA at the highest level in the United States and thanked the participants for their active efforts.

Another speaker at this event was Marina Ovtsynova, President of ALLATRA International Public Movement from Atlanta, USA. She thanked all the participants of the movement for their resilience and dedication to the common goal of creating a safe future free from the threats of the global climate crisis.

Olga Schmidt, President of the Creative Society International Project, noted in her speech, ""Our experience interacting with the United Nations and other international organizations shows that we can create the conditions necessary to find a way out of the climate collapse and build a sustainable and prosperous future for all through joint efforts.""

Continuing the topic of climate research, a climate change expert Dr. John Ahn and an independent climate change researcher Taliy Shkurupiy delivered a report prepared specially for the meeting. 

ALLATRA International Public Movement and the Creative Society International Project express solidarity and support for the sustainable development goals determined by the United Nations, highly value the UN's efforts in fighting climate change and strive to make a significant contribution to promote a deeper understanding of climate change factors and emphasize the role of the anthropogenic impact.

We sincerely thank everyone who organized and attended this landmark event. Together, we can preserve democracy, defend human rights and freedoms, and overcome the exponential growth of climate disasters.

The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (198 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.

jfX3eKKwbX4,Biden: 'The Climate Crisis Is Here',"“The past few days of Hurricane Ida, and the wildfires in the West and the unprecedented flash floods in New York and New Jersey is yet another reminder that these extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” Biden said.

The remnants of Hurricane Ida ripped through New York, New Jersey and across the Northeast early Thursday, killing at least eight people and triggering tornadoes, thunderstorms and torrential rain that inundated streets and paralyzed transport services.

Video of flooding posted on social media showed major thoroughways, airport terminals, baseball stadiums and subway stations turned into wading pools. Seven people died in Brooklyn and Queens, a police spokesman said. An eighth was killed in Passaic, New Jersey, according to local news outlets. Tornadoes hit Maryland and New Jersey. Mayor Bill de Blasio declared an emergency for New York City, while Governor Kathy Hochul did the same for the state. 

“We’re enduring an historic weather event tonight with record breaking rain across the city, brutal flooding and dangerous conditions on our roads,” de Blasio said in a tweet.

In Manhattan’s Central Park, 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) of rain fell in an hour and as much as 5.2 inches was recorded by 11 p.m., said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. Emergency flash flood warnings were posted from Delaware to Massachusetts. The New York Post reported four people had died in Queens and Brooklyn after getting trapped in their basements.

The deluge came less than two weeks after Tropical Storm Henri dumped a record amount of rain on New York City, and is the latest in a string of extreme weather events recorded around the world this year as climate change takes hold. Massive wildfires raging in California have blackened huge swaths of the state, western Canada and Siberia, sending smoke over the North Pole for the first time on record. 

Ida smashed into Louisiana on Sunday with record 150-mile-per-hour (241 kilometer) winds, leaving more than 1 million customers across the South, including New Orleans, without electric power and killing at least five people in Louisiana and Mississippi. 

The Northeast has had a particularly wet summer, with the saturated soil leaving the latest rainfall with no place to go. The National Weather Service earlier issued a Flash Flood Emergency for New York City and northeast New Jersey, a rare declaration that exceeds a warning designation. The service said it’s the first time it has sent out one for the region.

The service also issued a tornado warning for Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City, which expired at 9:30 p.m. A flash flood warning remained in place for large parts of Long Island.

De Blasio said bridges and tunnels remained open but roads were flooded around the city, with just the top of some cars peeking out. The city’s fire and police departments are prepared to assist if needed, de Blasio said in an interview on local news station NY1. “The part I’m worried about particularly is folks out on the road.”

The city’s subway system experienced severe service limitations as water poured onto underground platforms in Manhattan. Three branches of the Metro North Rail Road, which connects to the northern suburbs, were suspended, said Tim Minton, spokesperson for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city’s buses, subways and commuter rail lines. The Long Island Rail Road train service is suspended on all lines between Penn Station and Jamaica and between Atlantic Terminal and Jamaica.",2021-09-02T17:30:23Z,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,Bloomberg News,[],12009,84,426,PT58S,25,none,2540000,35943,1482464034

And the plusses of that for the environment has been clear…as in clear skies and clean air. What is not so clear however is this: when it comes to greenhouse gases, the Internet is responsible for 2% of global emissions. If the Internet were a country, it would be ranked as the sixth largest polluter in the world. 

But the Internet is here to stay, so what can be done to make it greener? From individuals not hitting Reply All on emails or turning off Auto Play for videos, to data centres running on green energy and search engines giving back to the environment, host Prerna Pant looks at all the various ways we are Greening The ‘Net.

As the Vatican prepares the funeral for Pope Francis and church leaders begin to consider his replacement, we look at the late pontiff's environmental legacy. Pope Francis frequently called for action on the climate crisis and urged his followers to be good stewards of the Earth. He also openly criticized the role of wealthy nations and capitalism in causing the climate crisis. 

""He brought together the riches of Christian and Catholic tradition to bear with the prophetic work of social movements around the world in confronting a global crisis,"" says Nathan Schneider, professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder.

q-lf6kyE_zQ,Will COP29 yield a viable agreement on climate change? | Inside Story,"World leaders are meeting to address the climate crisis.
Azerbaijan is hosting this year's UN COP29 conference, with delegates tackling ways to curb global warming.
Scientists warn progress is not on track and inaction could cause irreversible damage to our planet.
Funding is also on the agenda.
Developing nations need lots of it - up to a trillion dollars, to help reduce the impact of natural disasters, made worse by climate change. 
But some are questioning if the re-election of Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic, will change plans or even derail agreements. 
So will politics play a role at this gathering? 

Presenter: Elizabeth Puranam

Guests: 

Harjeet Singh - Global Engagement Director of the non-profit Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, a global campaign to accelerate a transition to renewable energy.

Nazanine Moshiri - Senior Analyst, Climate, Environment & Conflict, Africa at the International Crisis Group.

You can watch one video a month free on Nebula, sign up here (with 40% off) to access more: https://go.nebula.tv/simonclark

In this video I look at the claim that YouTube is killing the climate, and that more broadly streaming video is a huge emitter of carbon. As we will see, the claim (and the media coverage of it) tells us more about how we perceive climate change than it does about YouTube itself.

xWrIb-9KzaA,Climate Change Series – 6. Impacts of Climate Change on Humans,"#climatechange #earth #ngscience @NGScience 
https://ngscience.com
Climate change isn't just about melting icebergs or hotter summers. It's a global issue that affects every aspect of our lives, from our health to our jobs and even where we can live. As our planet undergoes these dramatic shifts, it's crucial for us to understand how these changes are impacting us directly.

Health Concerns:
With the planet heating up, we're seeing more and more heatwaves. These can lead to severe health problems, like heat strokes, and in extreme cases, deaths. Warmer climates also create ideal conditions for mosquitoes to thrive, leading to the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue. On top of that, the quality of the air we breathe is deteriorating, causing a rise in breathing problems and aggravating allergies.

Food and Water Scarcity:
Our changing climate is having a big impact on farming. Rain isn't as predictable as it used to be, and rising temperatures can make it harder for crops to grow. This means less food and potentially higher prices. The water situation isn't great either; glaciers, which are vital freshwater sources, are melting, and weird rainfall patterns are affecting river levels. Additionally, our oceans are becoming more acidic, which messes with the marine food chain, especially fish populations.

Economic Impacts:
People's jobs are getting hit hard by climate change. Fields like agriculture, fishing, and even tourism are feeling the pinch as nature becomes less predictable. Food prices are going up because there's less produce available. And when extreme weather strikes? The damage to roads, bridges, and buildings can cost a ton to repair.

Threat to Coastal Habitats:
Our beautiful coastlines are under threat. With rising sea levels, beaches are eroding, and we're losing vital habitats, like the protective mangroves and colorful coral reefs. These aren't just picturesque spots; they play a huge role in supporting diverse marine life and protecting the coast from storm surges.

Displacement and Migration:
Imagine being forced to leave your home because it's either under water or too dry to live in. That's the reality for many as seas rise, swallowing up coastal areas and even entire islands. Meanwhile, violent weather events, from hurricanes to floods, are uprooting entire communities. And in some places, constant droughts and expanding deserts mean people have to move elsewhere to find water and resources to survive.


As the planet continues to experience these profound changes, the ripple effects touch every corner of our lives. The challenges presented by climate change are not just environmental but deeply personal. They affect our health, our food, our livelihoods, and even our homes. Yet, understanding these impacts gives us the knowledge and the motivation to make a difference. Every effort counts, and by working together and making informed decisions, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and hopeful future.",2023-09-15T03:13:29Z,UC5g3t_XWCC2jNLFA1POenCw,Next Generation Science,"['Carbon', 'Greenhouse', 'Emissions', 'Warming', 'Glaciers', 'Methane', 'Ozone', 'Deforestation', 'Sea-level', 'Temperature', 'Mitigation', 'Adaptation', 'Extinction', 'Drought', 'CO2', 'Albedo', 'Icecaps', 'Feedback', 'Radiative', 'Atmosphere', 'Renewable', 'Biodiversity', 'Permafrost', 'Sink', 'Ocean-acidification', 'Cyclones', 'ngscience', 'ngscience.com', 'next generation', 'science', 'scientific', 'demonstration', 'kids', 'children', 'students', 'school', 'teacher', 'resource', 'elementary', 'primary', 'educational', 'learning', 'instructional', 'informative', 'classroom']",34009,238,7,PT4M7S,27,none,179000,629,24964094

eyXt25WdiFo,Climate Change Projections for New Zealand,"What are Climate Projections?
Climate projections are modelled representations of the potential future climate over the next several decades, using climate scenarios developed by the IPCC.

Projections are not predictions or forecast. They show a range of possibilities, based on the best available science and data, to give us an indication of what we might expect in the future.

Climate change projections consider different scenarios, such as varying levels of greenhouse gas emissions. They help scientists, policymakers, and communities understand potential future climate conditions and plan accordingly to mitigate or adapt to the expected changes.

Updated climate projections for Aotearoa New Zealand, produced by NIWA in 2024, will support our transition to a low-emissions, climate-resilient economy.

GGtAilkWTtI,Global Warming: An Inconvenient History,"This is the story of how we discovered the planet was warming, and why. Learn the building blocks of climate science with Brilliant: https://www.brilliant.org/simonclark

The climate crisis is caused by a build up of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, which traps energy and raises the planet's average temperature. This was discovered over the course of 200 years by a large cast of chemists, physicists, geologists, and other scientists. Some of them you may know, such as Joseph Fourier and Charles Keeling, but many of them are less well known. This video tells the remarkable story of men and women like Eunice Foote, Roger Revelle, Guy Callendar, and James Croll. But there's still more to be told! If you would like to see part 2 of the story, focusing on the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, let me know in the comments.

Our home is burning. Rapid climate change is destabilizing our world. It seems our emissions will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming and we may soon hit tipping points that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization.

While scientists, activists and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to do anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change. It seems humanity can’t overcome its greed and obsession with short term profit and personal gain to save itself. 

And so for many the future looks grim and hopeless. Young people feel particularly anxious and depressed. Instead of looking ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids into this world. It’s an age of doom and hopelessness and giving up seems the only sensible thing to do. 

But that’s not true. You are not doomed. Humanity is not doomed.

This film begins with phenomena linked to climate change and then examines how Earth’s temperature is controlled, how we know it is changing, and how the current changes compare to those over the last 800,000 years. Along the way, we meet scientists working at the forefront of climate change: fire scientist Crystal Kolden, soil scientist Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, atmospheric scientist Ralph Keeling, and ice core scientist Kathleen Wendt. The scientists explain how we know what we know about Earth’s changing climate and make the critical point that we can solve climate challenges.

HPUL7gnqnns,Water Resources Agency trumpets new scheme for reducing carbon emissions,"The Water Resources Agency is trumpeting a new scheme for reducing carbon emissions. Every year, the agency carries out hundreds of major engineering projects. This year, they claim carbon reduction measures cut the carbon footprint of projects by 20%. The scheme includes new guidelines, as well as modelling programs to work out where the best carbon savings can be made.

The Water Resources Agency has published carbon reduction guidelines for water construction projects. And having gained certification from the British Standards Institution, they hope to move toward net zero carbon emissions.

Lai Chien-hsin
Water Resources Agency head
Getting their certification gives us more confidence in our future zero carbon work. And we hope it will function to spread it, so that systematic work can be carried out in water engineering projects nationwide.

The Water Resources Agency pursues over 300 engineering projects a year. But the carbon emissions involved are hard to calculate. That’s why in November 2021, a team began creating the “Carbon Reduction Management Mechanism.” Self-writing modelling programs calculate the potential carbon reductions when a project is budgeted, all the way from planning and design to construction and long-term operations. That helps projects cut their emissions.

Wang Mei-hua
Minister of Economic Affairs
The Water Resources Agency looked very seriously into this, to see how we can reduce carbon in our engineering. Most importantly, we can change the whole ecosystem with our construction.

Lai Chien-hsin
Water Resources Agency head
We proscribed a standard volume, 587,000 tons a year. We set a target to reduce that by 20% in 2022. And so far, we’ve managed to reduce emissions by about 20.5%, so we’ve already surpassed our original target.

Taiwan’s 12 key strategies to reduce carbon emissions, and its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, put no limits on the Water Resources Agency. The new carbon reduction measures have been adopted by the agency proactively, as a step toward reversing the effects of climate change.",2022-11-24T14:29:18Z,UC21BtM_TJfRfOyEWKlrBgfQ,民視英語新聞 Taiwan News Formosa TV,"['民視', '民視新聞', 'English News', 'Formosa News', '英語新聞']",284,8,0,PT2M21S,25,none,100000,25696,31275211
UvqlHELfCok,Where Most Emissions Come From (But You Don’t Control Them),"Not all emissions are under your control — but they still count.

In this 30-second explainer, we break down the three types of emissions companies report:

✅ Scope 1 – direct emissions from things you own or operate (like fuel and vehicles)
✅ Scope 2 – indirect emissions from purchased electricity
✅ Scope 3 – everything else: from suppliers, business travel, product use, even waste

Scope 3 is usually the largest — and the hardest to measure.

But understanding it is key to any credible climate or net zero strategy.

qWfhyzslWJA,U.S. unveils plan to reduce carbon emissions by 2030,"The Obama administration has announced an ambitious plan to significantly reduce carbon emissions in the U.S. plant sector.
Supporters of the plan say it'll give Washington greater leverage to push countries like China and India to do more to fight climate change.
Choi You-sun reports. 
""Today, EPA is proposing a Clean Power Plan that will cut carbon pollution from our power sector, by using cleaner energy sources, and cutting energy waste.""

The Obama administration's new plan requires America's 1-thousand power plants to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to 30 percent of 2005 levels by the year 2030.
Nearly two-fifths of electricity in the U.S. is generated by coal-fueled plants.
Each U.S. state has a number of ways to achieve this.
They can increase their power plants' heat rates, rely more on natural gas or other sources for energy, and raise energy efficiency.
The Environmental Protection Agency says more than 90 billion U.S. dollars of climate and health-related costs will be saved from the plan and up to 150-thousand asthma attacks in children and over 3-thousand heart attacks could be prevented.

""Often these illnesses are aggravated by air pollution, pollution from the same sources that release carbon and contribute to climate change. We've got to do more to reduce it.""

Despite the government's assurances that the new rules will bring down electricity bills by eight percent and encourage investment in new technologies, business groups and lawmakers from coal-reliant states oppose the initiative.

""The administration has set out to kill coal and its 800-thousand jobs. If it succeeds, we'll all be paying a lot more electricity.""

After a period of public comment, the regulations will be finalized in June of next year, after which states can submit their own carbon reduction plans.

QnzSHsi4pus,Extreme Weather: What Role Does Global Warming Play? – the Earth101 lecture,"Humans have had to cope with extreme weather events throughout their history. However, the data show that the number of certain types of extreme events is on the rise in recent decades. For some types of extremes, such as heat waves, droughts and extreme rainfall events, this is an expected outcome of global warming. Other consequences have surprised climate researchers, such as changes in the jet stream and planetary waves in the atmosphere that have been linked to some unprecedented recent extreme events.

Stefan Rahmstorf obtained his PhD in oceanography at Victoria University of Wellington in 1990. He has worked as a scientist at the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute, at the Institute of Marine Science in Kiel and since 1996 at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. His work focuses on the role of the oceans in climate change.  

In 1999 Rahmstorf was awarded the $ 1 million Centennial Fellowship Award of the US-based James S. McDonnell foundation. Since 2000 he teaches Physics of the Oceans as a professor at Potsdam University. Rahmstorf served from 2004–2013 in the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) and was one of the lead authors of the 4th IPCC Assessment Report.

Dr. Rahmstorf has published over 100 scientific papers (30 in leading journals such as Nature, Science and PNAS) and co-authored four books. Available in English are Our Threatened Oceans (2009, with Katherine Richardson) and The Climate Crisis (2010, with David Archer).

“Extreme Weather: What Role Does Global Warming Play?” is a part of series of lectures given at the University of Iceland on May 27th 2016 at the conference ""The Past, the Future. How Fast, How Far? Threats Facing the Climate System""

Program:

Guðni Elísson: “Earth2016”

Michael E. Mann: “Dire Predictions: Understanding Climate Change”
Stefan Rahmstorf: “Rising Seas: How fast, How Far?”
Stefan Rahmstorf: “Is the Gulf Stream System Slowing?”

x49Zty8NT1k,#TheRoadAhead - CLEPA Sustainability Manifesto | Schaeffler | Climate Action,"🍃 How is the automotive supply industry cutting emissions? 
 
Decarbonisation starts with renewable energy! Yet, achieving progress depends on the availability of renewable sources, nuclear energy, and carbon-neutral fuels, which vary by region and operation. 
 
A great example of this in action comes from Schaeffler: Frank Bauer shares how they generate their own electricity from renewable sources. At their campus in Erlangen, they installed two rooftop photovoltaic systems that generate enough electricity to power 280 homes. 
 
But the journey to climate neutrality is about more than just individual efforts. It requires a European-wide strategy that adapts to regional challenges and accelerates progress in key areas: 
 
✅ Scale up industrial renewable energy production and form partnerships for competitive hydrogen production 
✅ Accelerate wind and solar park deployment for sufficient, affordable renewable energy, strengthen grid capacity and accelerate deployment of interconnectors

In a world grappling with climate change and dwindling fossil fuel reserves, algae biofuel emerges as a beacon of hope—a sustainable solution poised to revolutionize how we power our planet. This groundbreaking book delves into the cutting-edge science, ethical considerations, and practical applications driving algae biofuel research today. From exploring photosynthesis-driven cultivation techniques to analyzing scalable lipid extraction methods, it unravels the intricate processes behind producing high-energy, eco-friendly fuels.

Discover how algae biofuel can transform industries like aviation, shipping, and power generation by offering cleaner alternatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions without relying on arable land. Yet, this journey isn’t just about technology; it also tackles critical challenges such as production costs, infrastructure limitations, regulatory hurdles, and public skepticism. Through actionable strategies and innovative breakthroughs—from genetically engineered algae strains to AI-driven bioreactors—the book charts a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Ethical debates around environmental justice, equitable access, and societal impacts take center stage, ensuring readers understand not only how but why algae biofuel matters in fostering fair and inclusive energy systems. With insights into existing legal frameworks, water resource management, and sustainability standards, the book provides a comprehensive roadmap for integrating algae biofuel into transportation grids, industrial processes, and global energy networks.

The Los Angeles winter wildfires have shocked the world, with a death toll of at least 16 and over 12,000 structures destroyed. Experts point to unusual weather patterns, including wet winters in 2022 and 2023 that fueled vegetation growth, followed by a dry 2024 season that turned plants into tinder. Strong Santa Ana winds worsened the situation, rapidly spreading flames, while reports suggest power cables may have ignited fires. Climate change activists highlight the growing intensity of such disasters, while political figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk blame California's environmental and DEI policies. The Palisades Fire remains a major threat, with fresh evacuations in Brentwood and Bel Air as officials investigate the root causes.

YKK7KNiAD2k,Why Indigenous Forest Guardianship is Crucial to Climate Action | Nonette Royo | TED,"Indigenous communities have looked after their ancestral forests for millennia, cultivating immense amounts of knowledge on how to protect, nourish and heal these vital environments. Today, 470 million Indigenous people care for and manage 80 percent of the world's biodiversity -- yet their legal rights to these lands are inexplicit and subject to exploitation by illegal loggers, miners and companies. Human rights lawyer Nonette Royo describes how her team at the Tenure Facility, an organization that provides legal assistance to Indigenous people by taking their land rights battles to court, will help these communities secure and defend 50 million hectares of forests over the next five years.

h7Tka40zM-o,WATCH: Biden calls climate crisis 'an existential threat' | 2023 State of the Union,"In his second State of the Union address, President Joe Biden said that the Inflation Reduction Act is “the most significant investment ever” on climate change. He noted extreme weather events and natural disasters that have affected the United States, including record-breaking storms, floods, droughts and wildfires, all of which can be made more severe and frequent due to climate change.

The president also touted federal efforts to build 500,000 EV charging stations across the country, and to make electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances more affordable for the average consumer through tax credits.

“The climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state,” Biden said. “It's an existential threat. We have an obligation — not to ourselves, but to our children and grandchildren — to confront it.”

Biden’s Feb. 7 address comes a year after Russia invaded Ukraine and amid new diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China over a suspected surveillance balloon. This is Biden’s second State of the Union address, as his first was a joint address to Congress in April 2021.

Last year, Biden used his address to emphasize themes of bipartisanship and unity. But he now faces a split Congress, with the GOP-led House launching efforts to investigate his family and his administration.

8q7_aV8eLUE,simpleshow explains the Carbon Footprint,"Carbon footprint for kids! You've probably heard about climate change and reducing your carbon footprint, but what is it exactly? Like a footprint, it's a mark you leave on the environment through actions that release harmful gases like CO2 from burning fossil fuels. The more fuel used, the bigger your footprint. For instance, driving emits CO2 not only from the engine but also from extracting, transporting, and refining the oil. Everything you own has a carbon footprint, from books to toothbrushes. Even an apple may have traveled thousands of miles. It's hard to leave no footprint, but by making thoughtful choices, you can reduce it. Learn more with simpleshow and start shrinking your carbon footprint today.

u7zwrzEyzkA,How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint,"Watch more How to Help Save the Environment videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/365-How-to-Reduce-Your-Carbon-Footprint

Your carbon footprint is how many greenhouse gases you release in your daily activities. Be remembered by your good deeds, not your carbon emissions.

Step 1: Turn thermostat up/down
Turn your thermostat up in the summer or down in the winter by just two degrees, and you’ll prevent hundreds of pounds of carbon dioxide from being released each year.

Tip
Close doors to rooms that you are not using to maximize heating and air conditioning. Insulate windows and doors to save even more heating costs.

Step 2: Unplug electronics
Turn off and unplug your computer, TV, and other electronics when you’re not using them. Even electronics in sleep mode draw power.

Tip
Leaving your TV cable box on 24 hours a day uses about 65% as much energy as a standard refrigerator.

Step 3: Change bulbs
Change all the incandescent bulbs in your home to compact fluorescent bulbs, which use about 75% less energy.

Step 4: Do full loads of laundry/dishwashing
Do your laundry or run a dishwasher only when you have a full load. It saves water and it’s an excuse not to clean.

Step 5: Eat local
Eat local: An organic out-of-season vegetable from the other side of the world may sound delicious, but it had to make that trip on a huge container ship.

Tip
Take a canvas tote with you shopping, so you have a ready – and better – answer to the question 'paper or plastic?'

Step 6: Bring own coffee cup/mug
Bring your own cup or mug when you buy coffee and stop tossing an average of 20 pounds of disposable cups a year.

Step 7: Cut back on bottled water
Cut back on bottled water. Most tap water is perfectly safe to drink, and making the plastic and transporting the bottles uses huge quantities of fossil fuels.

Step 8: Plant a tree
Plant a tree. Trees help reduce greenhouse gases, and every one counts. Consider it a peace offering to the Earth.

Step 9: Consolidate car trips
Don’t jump in your car every time you feel the urge to run an errand. Plan and consolidate your trips to cut down on gas.

Step 10: Carpool, public transportation, bike, or walk
When you can, carpool, use public transportation, or ride your bicycle. Or walk, proud to be treading lightly.

Continuing the planet’s long-term warming trend, global temperatures in 2021 were 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.85 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA’s baseline period, according to scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. NASA uses the period from 1951-1980 as a baseline to see how global temperature changes over time.

Collectively, the past eight years are the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880. This annual temperature data makes up the global temperature record – which tells scientists the planet is warming.

Xw9qoHKxtc0,The inequality of carbon emissions,"There is a certain inequality about carbon emissions. In the developed world, we've spent centuries burning them to industrialise our economies. We've enjoyed a quality of life that the human species has never before enjoyed. Yet, we now need to decarbonise.

It's easy for us to make pledges to meet net-zero because we now have great infrastructure and the wealth to do it.

But what about emerging markets? They have become our workshops. We import deflation in the form of cheap manufactured goods from them. In return, we export our carbon emission, through the factories they use to make our stuff. I don't know why but no one really talks about this topic.

Should emerging markets be allowed to develop and enjoy what we have? Or should they decarbonise and stay poor?

What do you think?

SdOaNELFmQY,2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit | BBC News,"The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.
 
The European Copernicus climate service said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the 1.5C threshold, as well as being the world's hottest year on record.
 
This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades.
 
But does bring us nearer to doing so, as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.

HqdmbI2xpvI,Climate Action Plan,"Climate disruption is already having diverse and wide ranging impacts on Ireland's environment, society, economic and natural resources. The Climate Action Plan sets out an ambitious course of action over the coming years to address this issue.

The Plan clearly identifies the nature and scale of the challenge. It outlines the current state of play across key sectors including Electricity, Transport, Built Environment, Industry and Agriculture and charts a course towards ambitious decarbonisation targets. Reflecting the central priority climate change will have in our political and administrative systems into the future, the Plan sets out governance arrangements including carbon-proofing our policies, establishment of carbon budgets, a strengthened Climate Change Advisory Council and greater accountability to the Oireachtas.

This Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. The leadership role both the Government and public bodies can play in taking early action on climate is fundamental to achieving our decarbonisation goals.

Taking decisive action to confront climate disruption will be a major challenge to every dimension of our society, but the benefits are huge – warmer homes, cleaner air, a sustainable use of the world's scarce resources, more connected communities, authentic values, and quality jobs in enterprises which can compete in a decarbonised world.

This is everyone's journey. From Government to businesses, communities to householders, climate action is collective action. The Climate Action Plan sets out the Government agenda; see what you can do to play your part.",2019-06-17T13:47:26Z,UCNmA1joZADctUgrffR02FCQ,"Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications","['Climate', 'Climate Action', 'Climate Change', 'Climate Action Plan']",4183,17,10,PT2M39S,22,none,347,139,10482740
l_Oe6YK0DgE,What is the RISKIEST Region in the US as the Climate Changes?,"Climate Change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters all around the world. And in the United States, more and more people seem to be moving to the places that are projected to be most impacted by climate change, from hazards such as flooding, wildfire, storms, drought and extreme heat; and leaving the most climate-resilient areas. At first glance, this seems like a bizarre and paradoxical trend. So, for this episode of Weathered, we decided to see if we could get to the bottom of it. 

We spoke to experts and sifted through lots of data about moving trends and shifting climate patterns to figure out what’s really going on here and what you can do to avoid moving into harm’s way.

Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.

nzwX9XkPCnQ,Blockchain for Carbon Credits: Transparency or Scam?,"In the fight against climate change, carbon credits have become a crucial tool for companies and governments to offset their emissions. However, the traditional carbon credit system has been plagued by issues of transparency and accountability. This is where blockchain technology comes in, promising to revolutionize the industry with decentralized and tokenized carbon credits. But can blockchain really provide the transparency and trust needed to make a real impact, or is it just a new form of greenwashing? In this video, we'll delve into the world of blockchain for carbon credits, exploring the potential benefits and drawbacks of this emerging trend. From pulse blockchain to renewable tokens, we'll examine the role of digital ecology and decentralized green initiatives in the quest for sustainability. Join us as we explore the intersection of cryptocurrency and carbon solutions, and ask the question: can blockchain really help us achieve a more climate-friendly future?",2025-04-18T14:43:47Z,UCJTYLjx3zs3kNcuGhOwaILw,Abhishek Wadhwa,"['blockchain carbon', 'carbon initiative', 'carbon solutions', 'carbon tokenization', 'climate crypto', 'crypto carbon', 'crypto emissions', 'cryptocurrency carbon', 'decentralized carbon', 'decentralized credits', 'decentralized green', 'digital assets', 'digital carbon assets', 'digital ecology', 'green initiatives', 'pulse blockchain', 'renewable blockchain', 'renewable crypto', 'renewable tokens', 'sustainability crypto', 'token carbon', 'token economy', 'tokenized carbon', 'tokenized sustainability']",8,0,7,PT15M21S,28,none,41,180,2461

_OBD2qNFXpI,How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly - BBC News,"Travelling by plane has never been more popular, with four billion passengers flying every year.

But aviation emissions contribute to climate change, and scientists say we need to do more to tackle the problem.

BBC research has found that only a tiny fraction of passengers travelling with the world's biggest airlines are choosing to offset their carbon footprints.

Carbon offset schemes involve paying extra in order to contribute to environmental projects that reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, though some say it's just an excuse to continue polluting.

But it's not the only way to reduce the impact of your flight on the planet.

BBC environment reporter Laura Foster explains some of the things you can do to reduce the carbon footprint of your flight.

NPRIg6wIj30,"After Years Of Holding Steady, Carbon Emissions Climbing Again","Carbon emissions plated for year. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, the hosts of The Young Turks, tell you why they’re back on the rise. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M

“Between 2014 and 2016, global carbon emissions stayed flat. That may have been false hope. New projections suggest that emissions in 2017 are likely to increase, thwarting the drive toward keeping global temperatures from continuing to rise.

Under the Paris accord, the world needs to hit net-zero emissions by about 2050, meaning that we either stop burning fossil fuels or only burn them when we can capture and bury their emissions. Otherwise we won’t be able to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century—a threshold beyond which dangerous changes to the climate may be irreversible.

The latest estimates were released at the climate talks in Bonn by the Global Carbon Project. Emissions have gone into reverse for a variety of reasons, with those from India and China rising faster than expected and those from the US and Europe failing to decline as quickly as expected.

“Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are still not being matched by actions,” says Glen Peters, a research director at CICERO, one of the authors of the new estimate. “It is far too early to proclaim that we have turned a corner and started the journey towards zero emissions.”

Countries met in Bonn last week to hash out better ways to coordinate climate action. In reply to Donald Trump’s intention to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, Syria and Nicaragua—the last two hold outs—have agreed to join the accord. A contingent of US lawmakers and philanthropists are telling other countries that Trump’s intentions don’t reflect those of the US as a whole.”

India is going through a climate crisis! In some parts, extreme heat is causing bats to drop dead and people to suffer. In Delhi, temperatures hit record highs, with devastating consequences, including the deaths from heatstroke. In other regions, like the northeast, heavy rainfall and cyclones are causing severe floods and landslides. As climate change intensifies, India faces a future of more frequent and severe heatwaves, unprecedented storms, rising sea levels, and widespread desertification. Despite the escalating dangers, the government remains largely silent, failing to address the urgent need for action. With 90% of India's population at risk, particularly the poor and those who work outdoors, the crisis is deepening, yet it barely makes headlines or political discussions. But how big is this problem and why is our government silent? Let's find out in this video.

oDyIY1qTNhM,Climate Change Is Already Impacting Our Health,"Massive storms, flooding, extreme heat, droughts, air pollution, increased rates of disease, changes to our food and water… global warming, and the changes to climate that come with it, are increasing human health risks. Our physical and mental health both stand to suffer, and some populations are more vulnerable than others. What are the specific health issues, what can we do to address them, and most importantly – is there any hope?
 
We hope to answer these questions and more in a handful of episodes on Climate Change and Health. This year, we’re going to be taking  a look at how Climate Change can impact health.

The purpose is to encourage businesses to make a first calculation of their carbon footprint. It is important to accept that it may take any business a couple of years before the knowledge, understanding, and data collection systems, particularly for Scope 3, provide an accurate figure in tonnes of CO2e. 

Based very loosely around the tale of Pandora’s Box, Businesses need to look at their impact and carbon emissions to quantify and then plan to mitigate. Do look at the complementary training videos available on our YouTube channel. Enjoy all and remember to ‘Like’.

We hope those talks will inspire you to think of new ways you can have an impact with Google’s tools or provide operational or practical hints to improve and optimize your workflows.

Two years ago, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) announced that 32 projects from 22 countries were awarded production licenses and technical support to tackle some of the world’s greatest challenges using open geospatial data. As the GEO-GEE Programme draws to a close, we’re excited for the project teams to share their results and outcomes over the next few Lightning Talk episodes. In June, we’ll hear from project teams on how they used Google Earth Engine to support climate action & science.

BoHFdOW8UeM,Why is Africa bearing the brunt of the climate crisis?,"'People are saying the climate crisis is real, only because it has knocked on the door of the global north,' says Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate activist.
Subscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub

Africa accounts for 15% of the world’s population but 4% of greenhouse emissions – compared with 23% by China and 19% by the US. 

More than 18m people in the Horn of Africa risk starvation after years of drought, but the countries suffering the worst effects of climate change did not cause this global crisis. 

Here Nakate speaks about this climate injustice, ahead of next month's Cop27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, when countries from across the global south will call for billions of dollars of  financing for adaptation, the transition to green energy, and climate reparations.

dqnZkvKIo0g,How climate change threatens coffee production | DW Documentary,"Climate change could halve the amount of land suitable for coffee production by 2050. In a bid to save one of the world’s most popular drinks, many people are busy experimenting with more resilient coffee varieties and sustainable growing methods.

In Uganda, about 1.8 million smallholders make their living growing coffee. Coffee beans are one of the East African country’s most important exports. But droughts, torrential rain, and pest damage are increasing problems. The most common types of coffee, Arabica and Robusta, are at risk because they need stable temperatures. That’s why Davis Kuloba and other farmers are now pinning their hopes on a wild type of coffee, Liberica, which appears to be more climate-resilient and resistant to pests. However, not everyone is convinced by its taste. There’s still more work to be done to improve how its cultivated and processed. 
In the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador, a cooperative is growing coffee under the shade of other trees. This model runs counter to conventional, industrial-scale coffee plantations. It’s hoped that this strategy, known as agroforestry, will help future-proof coffee production. More and more coffee roasting companies in Germany are showing an interest in alternative forms of cultivation. The industry is changing, thanks to the rise of resilient bean varieties, sustainable cultivation, and fairer trade conditions. Coffee — fit for the future.

D9LttJzbFuw,Will politicians listen to climate change warnings? | Inside Story,"For more than a century industrialisation has spread across much of the world.
The planet is getting warmer and the places on it, where humanity can live healthily, are getting fewer.
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - or IPCC - has brought together scientists from 195 countries to solve the problem.
In the last eight months, it's published two reports looking at the causes and effects of climate change.
Its third one has just been released, suggesting what we can do to reverse the damage.
So what should be done to limit this damage?

Subscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub

Floods are natural phenomena, a result of storms, but the climate crisis is amplifying their damage. Rising sea levels, driven by melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of water, are increasingly inundating coastal areas, while warmer temperatures are causing more moisture to accumulate in the atmosphere, which is released as rain or snow.

Scientists have said flash floods are becoming a problem in some countries, with short, severe bursts of rain causing anything from inconvenience to mayhem

The addition of anthropogenic greenhouse gases has led to global warming which is impacting humans on the planet.  A discussion of the greenhouse effect and greenhouse gases (including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs) is included.  Countries have committed to reduce through both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.

ACuCWvPrHOs,Our biggest experiment: A history of the climate crisis | RSA Replay,"How did the world become addicted to fossil fuels? How did we discover that electricity may be our saviour?

Who first sounded the alarm bell for climate change, and how could we seemingly ignore all these papers from the 1960s or 1970s musing that “if” we didn’t do anything, climate change could worsen significantly after the year 2000?

As we look forward to COP26, Alice Bell takes us back to explore the earliest signs and causes of climate change in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, through the advancing realisation that global warming was a significant problem in the 1950s and right up to the growth of the environmental movement, climate scepticism and present-day political responses.

The science and numbers are vital to understanding climate change but they’re only part of the story. If we really want to understand the evolution of the climate crisis, we’re going to have to look deeper at the story behind the science; who commissioned what, why, when, and how was it received? This is a new perspective on the climate crisis, exploring deep back-stories, fascinating characters and asking the crucial question: how can we harness the ingenuity and intelligence that has driven the history of climate change research to create a more sustainable and bearable future for humanity?

Look out for more events on this theme coming up in our Regenerative Futures programme this autumn.

A song that talks about the dangers of climate change :  A WARNING!  It's not going to make you happy, that's for sure.
#climatechangesong #climatechange #climatesong 
If you're  worried about the future of our planet, like some of us, then you'll want to stay away from this song. It's not going to make you feel better about the state of our planet, it's just going to make you angry.

A WARNING is an angry song about the consequences of climate change and the devastation it's causing. It's not a happy song, it's a warning that talks about the dangers of climate change, and how important and critical it is to do all we can to help prevent it.

🎼SONG LYRICS/ A Warning : a song about climate change & global warming
( short version )

Are your summers getting hotter, 
And winters more extreme, 
Through the floods and forest fires
Can you hear the planet scream? 

The disappearing icecaps, 
Tsunamis and the droughts, 
Are we on a dying planet
With no way out? 

Tell us, who decided this and why? 
Who pulled the trigger, condemned us all to die? 
How did this happen? Who decided this, and why? 
Who pulled the trigger, sentenced us all to die? 

Global warming, can you feel the climate change? 
We're killing our future, don't you think its strange? 
This is a warning, can you feel the planet change? 
We're burning our home down, don't you think its strange? 

When the last living humans are crying out aloud, 
Will they flaunt their GDP under the killer carbon shroud? 
When every living creature around us has died,
Too late to feel regret, that we never really tried...

Could we have changed the way we lived, and learnt to share? 
Reduced our carbon footprint, through recyle and repair? 
Ditched the fossil fuels, and switched to other ways? 
Did we consume the earth in our mad consumer race? 

Global warming, can you feel the planet change? 
We're burning our home down, don't you think its strange? 
This is a warning, can you feel the climate change? 
We're killing our future, don't you think its strange?

B9G1-nNdXTs,Meteorologist on receiving death threats over his climate crisis reports,"Some scientists believe that July 4th may have been one of the hottest days on Earth in 125,000 years, and we keep breaking these records. The earth’s average temperature set a new unofficial record on Thursday, the third such milestone in a week that was already rated as the hottest on record. Meteorologist Chris Gloninger discusses receiving death threats for reporting on the climate crisis before leaving the TV news profession as a result with Joy Reid.

7WCXFoDsjcQ,"""We need all hands on deck for faster, bolder climate action"" | United Nations #shorts","United Nations Secretary General António Guterres at the Opening Ceremony of the Climate Implementation Summit at COP27. 

""We need all hands on deck for faster, bolder climate action.
A window of opportunity remains open, but only a narrow shaft of light remains.
The global climate fight will be won or lost in this crucial decade – on our watch. 
One thing is certain: those that give up are sure to lose.
So let’s fight together– and let’s win. ""

-----------
At COP 27, countries come together to take action towards achieving the world’s collective climate goals as agreed under the Paris Agreement and the Convention. Building on the outcomes and momentum of COP 26 in Glasgow last year, nations are expected to demonstrate at COP 27 that they are in a new era of implementation by turning their commitments under The Paris Agreement into action. The conference will take place from 6-18 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Heads of State and Government will attend the Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit on 7 and 8 November. A high-level segment primarily attended by Ministers will take place from 15-18 November.

Not quite…a new study reveals that there is a winter-weather trend that OVERPOWERS CLIMATE CHANGE. To better understand this, we are taking it back to March of 1993 to look at The Storm of the Century, which brought record breaking cold temperatures and 20 INCHES OF SNOW to ALABAMA! By going back, we can better answer questions like: What causes this set up to occur in our atmosphere? And why are we still seeing extreme cold and SNOW IN THE SOUTH? Buckle up as our experts talk the jet stream, polar vortex, and this stubborn cold exception so we can answer the ultimate question: Are these winter storms here to stay? Watch this episode to find out.

1e15MnlVHFw,What is Climate Change Adaptation?,"Our changing climate is affecting the places we live and work, but climate change adaptation can help. Climate change adaptation is all the ways we can change, or 'adapt' to the effects of climate change so we can stay fed, comfortable and safe.


* * * * *  Transcription  * * * * *

Climate change is causing all sorts of problems for our planet.
Making it harder for the plants and animals that live here.
And for the people too.

The places we live and work are being affected more by blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding.

The crops we grow for food are suffering more from not enough water, and from too much.

And playing soccer or riding a bike during a heat wave…  I don’t think so!

The effects of climate change can harm our communities, food supplies, and way of life.
And be dangerous to our health and safety.

Hopefully, we can slow down or stop our climate from continuing to change, but most of the changes cannot be undone. 

We need to learn how to live with these changes.
We need to learn how to adapt to them.

Climate change adaptation is all the ways we adapt, or change, how we do things to make it easier and safer to live with our changing climate.

It is designing communities, so they are protected from flooding.
It is taking care of water supplies to help farmers when there is too much or too little rain.
It is planting rooftop gardens on buildings to help keep our cities cooler, and use less energy.
And so much more!

You and I, we need to keep fighting climate change.
But for the changes that are here to stay, climate change adaptation will help us stay fed, comfortable and safe.",2022-11-18T21:29:38Z,UCdPRKH8tJ1VTsTdDc8c8fGg,Environment and Climate Change Canada,"['climate change', 'climate change adaptation', 'adaptation', 'NAS', 'environment and climate change', 'climate change mitigation', 'mitigation']",190710,503,0,PT1M48S,28,none,9930,189,4510140

President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence briefly attended the summit but left after just 14 minutes. At the beginning of the summit, 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered an impassioned address to world leaders, explicitly naming their inaction on the climate crisis. Youth climate activists from around the world also spoke at UNICEF about a landmark new climate complaint they filed with the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. Finally, we speak with Chief Raoni Metuktire of the Kayapó tribe, who traveled to New York to protest deforestation of the Amazon under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

The Australian has reported investors are pushing for greater climate ambition, warning of a capital flight.

It comes as the federal government has officially committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

""Sorry, which government is standing in the way of somebody who wants to invest in renewable energy? None,"" Mr Murray said.

""Which government is standing in the way of lower carbon emissions technology in agriculture? None.

""Who's doing it in transport? None. Who's doing it in cars? None.

E5nlM6l43qI,UN Secretary-General on Sea-level Rise - Security Council | Climate Action | United Nations,"Remarks by António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, on the Threats to international peace and security (Sea-level rise) - Security Council, 9260th meeting.

The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, called the consequences of sea-level rise “unthinkable” and warned, “Low-lying communities and entire countries could disappear forever. We would witness a mass exodus of entire populations on a biblical scale. And we would see ever-fiercer competition for fresh water, land and other resources.”

Addressing the Security Council today (14 Feb) in New York, Guterres said, “Rising seas threaten lives, and jeopardize access to water, food and healthcare. Saltwater intrusion can decimate jobs and entire economies in key industries like agriculture, fisheries and tourism.”

He stressed, “It can damage or destroy vital infrastructure — including transportation systems, hospitals and schools, especially when combined with extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis. And rising seas threaten the very existence of some low-lying communities and even countries.”

The UN chief said, “Under any scenario, countries like Bangladesh, China, India and the Netherlands are all at risk.”

He continued, “Mega-cities on every continent will face serious impacts including Cairo, Lagos, Maputo, Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai, Copenhagen, London, Los Angeles, New York, Buenos Aires and Santiago.”

According to Guterres, the danger is especially acute for nearly 900 million people who live in coastal zones at low elevations. “That’s one out of ten people on earth,” he said.

Also addressing the Council, Csaba Kőrösi, the President of the UN General Assembly, said, “We know the risks, and we see the uncertainties and instabilities that we are going to face. And we can’t doubt that these will open the door for conflict and dispute, endangering global peace and security. And where this door is open, this Council has a responsibility to act.”

He continued, “It is critical to invest in prevention today, rather than address the implications of food scarcity and mass migration tomorrow. We can agree it makes sense morally and financially.”

In his address to the Council, Bogdan Aurescu, Co-Chair of the International Law Commission Study Group on Sea-Level Rise and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Romania, said, “The international community must find innovative instruments to support such efforts.”

He noted, “Last September during the high-level events staying ahead of the curve, climate security and international law, organized by Germany and Palau in New York. In the margins of the General Assembly high level week, I made the proposal of creating an international voluntary fund for this purpose. And I renew this proposal today.”

On the same meeting, Coral Pasisi, Director of Climate Change of the Pacific Community (SPC) said, “A nation can be at war and its people still have hope and determination to survive. The war against climate change is quite different.”

She continued, “The opponent is much larger and amorphous and the ability to stop it is outside of your direct control. And whilst you can do your best to adapt with the limited resources you have you continue to suffer loss and damage and fear for the future of your children.”

Also addressing the Security Council today, Malta’s Minister for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade Ian Borg noted, “As climate change catalyzes new wave of activism around the world, threats and violence against women and environmental defenders is increasing. Especially against indigenous women.”

He stressed, “Their protection must be an integral part of the global agenda for peace building, and for sustaining peace.”",2023-02-15T04:00:06Z,UC5O114-PQNYkurlTg6hekZw,United Nations,"['UN', 'United Nations', 'UNGA', 'UN General Assembly', 'General Debate', 'Naciones Unidas', 'Организация Объединенных Наций', 'OOH', 'Nations Unies', '联合国', 'الأمم المتحدة', 'The Global Goals', 'Sustainable Development Goals', 'Human Rights', 'UN Peacekeepers', 'Security Council', 'World Leaders', ""l'Assemblée générale"", 'Генеральной Ассамблеи', 'La Asamblea General']",8522,230,112,PT9M33S,25,none,3100000,18742,456819284

NAbP94V7sJ8,Spain floods: Is Europe prepared for climate change? | Counting the Cost,"It is Spain’s worst natural disaster in recent history and some scientists are linking it to global warming.

Devastating floods across the eastern region of Valencia have destroyed roads, railways, other infrastructure and businesses.

Recovery efforts are still under way, but the total cost is likely to be enormous.

The government has approved more than $11bn in loans and grants to help storm and flood victims.

But many Spaniards are outraged by what they say is a slow response to the crisis.

Israel extends a lifeline for the Palestinian economy, but just for one month.

Plus, Africa’s energy potential.

During the last 200 years, human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels have increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by 40%. If unchecked, continuing emissions will warm up the planet by 2.6°C to 4.8°C by the end of this century. This would have serious implications for human societies and the natural world. 

This 60-second animation from the world's two leading science academies brings you the science behind climate change.

2024 marked a grim milestone in the climate crisis, with global temperatures rising to 1.6°C above preindustrial levels, surpassing the critical 1.5°C target for the first time. This unprecedented heat, fueled by fossil fuel emissions and natural phenomena like El Niño, triggered catastrophic weather events, including record-breaking heatwaves, floods, and storms, causing immense suffering worldwide. Despite global pledges, carbon emissions reached a new high, putting the planet on a trajectory toward a dangerous 2.7°C of warming by century's end. Scientists stress the urgent need for immediate action to phase out fossil fuels and mitigate the escalating climate emergency. Watch the video to know more.

Three Views on the Climate Change:
❌ Climate Change Deniers
🚨 Climate Alarmists
💭 Climate Realists

How important is the environment to Christians?
1️⃣ We are caretakers of the earth, but we are not to worship it. (Genesis 1v28)

Three main views on the environment according to Scott B Rae (“Moral Choices”)
🌎 Biocentric view - the environment suggests that the environment should be protected because it has intrinsic value.
🌎 Anthropocentric view - the environment has no inherent value.
🌎 Theocentric view - the environment has intrinsic value because it is God’s good creation.

2️⃣ Worship the Creator God, not the creation. (Romans 1v25)

3️⃣ Human life is valued above animal and plant life.

4️⃣ Our view on end times shouldn’t encourage the destruction of the earth.

5️⃣ Technology and cities are not evil.

6️⃣ Humans will be held accountable for what they do to the earth.

7️⃣ Father God will remake all that humans and devils have wickedly harmed, damaged, and destroyed. (Revelation 21v10-11; 22v3-5)

fe0SHVZGE98,How to Count ALL Human Carbon Emissions in the US,"Google Tech Talks
December 16, 2008

ABSTRACT

The Vulcan Project has estimated US fossil fuel CO2 emissions at the scale of individual factories, powerplants, roadways and cities. It has placed the inventory on a common 10 km x10 km grid at the hourly timescale for the year 2002. In addition to improvement in space and time resolution, Vulcan is quantified at the level of fuel type, economic sub-sector, and county/state identification. Vulcan is now estimating other years and including Canada and Mexico in its spatial domain.

Two development paths are planned: performing this effort across the planet at scales of ~ 100 km2 and downscaling the Vulcan effort within the US domain to all emitting sources with full energy demand-driven modeling in near realtime (codename: Hestia)

pf4aOlE_3bc,"Wildfires, floods, extreme weather: what one month in the global climate crisis means for Australia","In just one month, the world has been battered by wildfires, torrential flooding and extreme winds. Vehicles have been seen floating down the road in Belgium and China; and devastating fires have ripped through Siberia and much of the west coast of North America. In this extract from our Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor talks about how these are the scenes climate scientists have been warning of, and the only silver lining is that all the destruction might finally push laggard governments like Australia towards change.

AFvW5vwMcKk,From Fork to Forest: Why we can't solve the climate crisis without changing how we eat,"Our current system of animal agriculture generates as much greenhouse gas as the entire transportation sector, but no one is talking about it. Even if we stopped using fossil fuels today, emissions from our food system would still cause the Earth to exceed targets.

This lively presentation discusses our food system's underappreciated climate and environmental impact. Learn actions you can take at your next meal to start changing things for the better. Presented by Anna Larsson and Nicola Philpott. 

Anna Larsson spends her days working on strategy and finance in the corporate world. By night, she is a long-time climate and environmental activist. She lives with her partner and two teenagers in Minneapolis and loves biking and getting out in nature.

Nicola Philpott runs a plant-based meal program at a shelter for people experiencing homelessness in Minneapolis. She has a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biology and has written 18 peer-reviewed scientific publications. Nicola enjoys gardening, biking with her teenagers, and walking her dogs. She’s enthusiastic about empowering people to take climate action through plant-based eating.

Dwkh46MZuIc,What Are Carbon Footprints | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"What Are Carbon Footprints | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool

You can reduce your own contribution to climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide you release into the atmosphere.

Your carbon footprint is measured by the amount of extra carbon dioxide your lifestyle adds to the atmosphere as a result of the use of fossil fuels, or the cutting down of trees for example. 

If your country generates electricity without burning fossil fuel, for example nuclear power or replenishables such as wind or hydro, your carbon footprint will be reduced.

You can reduce your carbon footprint by insulating your house, triple-glazing your windows, drive your car efficiently or use public transport or walk, buy food locally, use LED lights and reduce the amount of red meat you eat.

6-67Gv5dS0c,Exhibition highlights climate crisis  / KBS  2025.04.22.,"[Anchor]

Today (Apr. 22) is 'Earth Day,' established to raise awareness about environmental pollution.

In celebration of Earth Day, exhibitions have been held to reflect on issues of environmental pollution and climate crisis.

Reporter Kim Hye-joo introduces the events.

[Report]

A reinterpreted work of Botticelli's 'The Birth of Venus,' familiar as the Venus on the sea, is not as beautiful upon closer inspection.

The work is composed of 240,000 plastic bags.

It visualizes the number of plastic bags consumed every 10 seconds, warning of environmental pollution that cannot be explained by numbers alone.

People drinking hot chocolate inside the Ice Cave Café, a landmark in Dubai, create an irony by intentionally making a cold place in the desert and enjoying warm beverages, prompting reflection on the destroyed nature.

Over 110 photographic works by four global artists represent the seriousness of the climate crisis.

[Seok Jae-hyun/Art Director: ""It’s about how the Earth relates to each of us, how individuals can come together to think and address these issues, and how we can solve them....""]

Actress Kim Hye-ja explains a key work that embodies the pain of the Earth in her own voice.

Iron, a key player in the development of civilization, is used as a printing plate to capture images of nature.

The protagonist is the endangered red-crowned crane, which used to visit the Han River estuary in winter.

Using iron, which may not seem fitting for nature conservation, the work expresses the black crane that we need to protect.

[Yoon Soon-young/Photographer: ""By showing nature through photographs on iron, we infuse it with vitality. It symbolizes that no matter how advanced this world becomes, everything ultimately returns to nature""]

The message from the artists, wishing for coexistence with nature on our one and only Earth, resonates with us.

This is KBS News, Kim Hye-joo.

There could be several causes for climate change, but the biggest one is the rising concentration of greenhouse gases. Simply put, greenhouse gases are those gases in our atmosphere that trap heat. Some examples include carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and ozone.

Natural sources and human activities both result in the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the most common ways these gases get released into the atmosphere is through the burning of fossil fuels. Burning coal or oil to run industrial processes or giant factories increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Indeed, fossil fuels' contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is the largest, in the range of 70- 80% of total emissions.

In this video, we explain, in simple terms, climate change and global warming and what we can do as a community and individually to save Earth from climate change.

Read","Panel Discussion with Robin Celikates, Andreas Malm, Eva von Redecker, and Rupert Read on the question ""What is to be Done? Climate Crisis and Political Activism"". This was the closing event of the Conference ""Politics of Nature: Philosophical Perspectives on the Anthropocene"" (Oct 20-21, 2022), organized by Thomas Khurana (Center for Post-Kantian Philosophy, https://cpkp.net/) and the ICI Berlin (https://www.ici-berlin.org/). 

What is to be Done? Climate Crisis and Political Activism
From a theoretical perspective, there seems to be widespread agreement about the extent, the causes, and the dire consequences of the climate crisis. Such consensus is absent, however, with regard to the practical-political question: what is to be done? Even if it seems obvious that a fundamental and global change of the economic and political system — a revolution of the whole mode of living — is necessary, it is unclear how exactly this can be achieved. What are the necessary and legitimate forms and means of such a transformation? To what extent are new forms of protest needed to respond to the urgency of the situation? What forms of disobedience and disruption or adaptation and moderation are necessary?",2022-11-14T23:19:29Z,UCdKO5dwlv3AQA_Ar_n0hp5Q,CPKP - Center for Post-Kantian Philosophy,[],5759,118,20,PT2H6M19S,22,none,1010,39,57808

But there’s a challenge: while these pledges and measures sound good, the reality is that these funds and incentives are often inadequate or delayed, difficult to access, or they come with conditions that don’t always align with the needs of the countries they’re meant to support.

So what can be done to address these challenges and how are they planning to mitigate this?

S0oGaoqSAl0,Floating cities as an innovative response to climate change | DW Documentary,"Sea levels are rising due to climate change. Many coastal cities are at growing risk of flooding. Architects are trying to react to this development with new ideas, such as floating cities. But this concept is not without its problems.

Architect Koen Olthuis is constructing a floating city in the Maldives, sustainably cooled with sea water. In the Netherlands, Sacha and Jan live in a waterborne section of the Steigereiland neighborhood. It's based on a complicated feat of engineering - but also depends on cooperation and solidarity. If one home is too heavy, it raises the one next door. Yet Sacha and Jan like its collaborative nature. The residents of the floating neighborhood all love living by the water, not far from the heart of Amsterdam.

In Germany, a University of Kiel project goes even further. Biologist Martina Mühl is researching the possibility of implementing aquaculture very close to home, so residents can tap their own fresh local supply of fish and seafood. 

Hamburg and Bremen have been responding to rising tides by constructing ever higher levees. But soon even this will no longer be enough to cope with the growing impact of climate change. This documentary shows possible alternatives to levees and how we might be able to cope with the rising sea levels in the future.

At least 10 people have died in the devastating Los Angeles wildfires as firefighters continue to battle multiple infernos in the area. Thousands of homes and other structures have been destroyed, and some 180,000 people are under evacuation orders. Multiple neighborhoods have been completely burned down, including in the town of Altadena, where our guest, climate scientist and activist Peter Kalmus, lived until two years ago, when increasing heat and dryness pushed Kalmus to leave the Los Angeles area in fear of his safety. ""I couldn't stay there,"" he says. ""It's not a new normal. … It's a staircase to a hotter, more hellish Earth."" Kalmus discusses an op-ed he recently published in _The New York Times_ about the decision, which he says was toned down by the paper's editors when he attempted to explain that fossil fuel companies' investment in climate change denial and normalization has only accelerated the pace of unprecedented large-scale climate disasters. ""This is going to get worse,"" he warns, ""Everything has changed.""

lAnM5zDNazg,What REALLY Happens When King Tides Hit Your Coast?,"🌊 King tides are more than just big waves — they’re a glimpse into our future.
On April 27, some coastal areas may flood due to extreme tides amplified by the moon's gravitational pull. These “king tides” offer a sneak peek at permanent sea level rise caused by climate change.

📈 As sea levels rise, today’s extreme tides could become tomorrow’s daily reality.
🧠 Learn what causes king tides, why they're increasing, and what you can do to help coastal scientists by submitting photos and observations.

📍 Live near the coast?
Check your local tide charts to know when to expect higher water levels — and stay safe!

Wondering what SDGs are? 
Today, societies are facing unprecedented and pressing social and environmental challenges, which have the potential to put a question mark over our very existence. To deal with these challenges, the United Nations has put forth an ambitious Agenda 2030 which lists out the Sustainable Development Goals agreed on by stakeholders from around the world in 2015.  These goals are a call for action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity and overall transformative action towards sustainability. More info: https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelop...

These videos are part of a series of 17 videos dedicated to all 17 SDGs created by CR3+ network (Hanken school of Economics in Finland, Audencia Business School in France, La Trobe Business School in Australia, and ISAE/FGV in Brazil).

C4UIrwVkN0A,What does Net Zero mean? Progress your organisation's climate action with our modular programme.,"Download the A to Zero modular programme and factsheet here https://hubs.ly/H0rvlFX0

We are in a climate crisis. To limit its impact, our focus must be on reaching Net Zero.

Simply put, Net Zero is achieved when we add no incremental greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. 
Net Zero requires two actions: massively reducing emissions to get as close to zero as possible and removing remaining emissions via carbon sinks. 

Climate change poses a significant threat to our communities, organisations and economies. But there is also opportunity on the path to Net Zero. Here is the chance for organisations to innovate, create new ways of operating, increase efficiency and drive forward change.

The journey to Net Zero is a challenging one which will include vital steps as we make the transition.
First, organisations must understand the climate impacts across all their operations, including the supply chain. This requires activities such as risk analysis, emissions calculations and setting targets based on climate science to ensure our strategies for action are robust.

Next, organisations must take urgent action on their full impact by reducing emissions in accordance with a science-based target.

Reducing emissions to zero, or as close to zero as possible will be on ongoing process that requires collaboration, innovation and redesign of existing operating practices.

Finally, removing remaining carbon from the atmosphere through carbon ‘sinks’ such as planting forests and new technologies for capturing and storing emissions will allow us to reach and maintain Net Zero. 

The work shouldn’t stop here. From Net Zero we can look towards a future beyond when we have a positive impact on planet and communities.

Net Zero is a crucial journey that we all must urgently take. 

Download the A to Zero programme below. Your journey starts here.

@CalliArtDrawing 

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

r-3C5pAagzw,Imre Szeman spurns the standard logic of climate action: that capitalism will save the Earth,"Imre Szeman is the inaugural Director of the Institute for Environment, Conservation and Sustainability and Professor of Human Geography at the University of Toronto Scarborough. His recent book, Futures of the Sun: The Struggle Over Renewable Life, examines corporate and state control of the transition to renewables.

We talk here about how Futures of the Sun explores the competing eco-stories being offered by people intent on shaping the transition to fit their vision and version of a renewable society. Imre discusses how key players are working hard to make sure a greener, cleaner future will look much like the world we live in today and examines the rhetoric, ideology, and politics of liberal nationalists intent on fighting a war against climate change, billionaire solar entrepreneurs who believe only in themselves, and the populist far right who want no change at all.

Offering possible new critical and political avenues, Szeman reveals how those on the environmental left can ensure their vision of egalitarianism beyond the status quo can become the reality of our renewable future.

Celebrate Earth Day by thinking with us about what's going on in the ersatz push for renewables and join the struggle for a future that is more radically democratic than the present.

TDYm297LBLw,Raghuram Rajan on why climate action & globalization are joined at the hip,"#ThePrintUncut
Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan spoke at the IMF-World Bank annual meet which has drawn sharp reactions in India. Raghuram Rajan while talking about the need to liberalize services said, 'We must think about the damage done to the world had India followed China's export-led growth path of manufacturing.' The former RBI governor spoke about why climate action needs continued globalization & possible policies that can enable both, especially considering the ongoing de-globalization which is occurring through a mix of old-fashioned protectionism & emerging geo-political concerns.

Lewis Akenji, managing director of the Hot or Cool Institute and lead author of the study, says it can’t be up to Canadians alone and that the federal government must play a role.

40IwmfnRUwU,Climate crisis: Can young people avert catastrophe? | The Stream,"In September 2018, UN climate scientists warned the world had only 12 years to limit global heating to 1.5C and limit the risk of extreme heat, floods and drought killing millions of people.

We’re now down to 11 years.

With the clock ticking on, the global climate emergency will be centre-stage at the United Nations on Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is convening a climate summit aimed at galvanising action to keep temperatures below 2C – and preferably to 1.5C. Guterres wants world political and business leaders to come up with workable plans to almost halve carbon emissions by 2020, on the road to net zero emissions by 2050.

But as older generations debate what is achievable, younger millennials and members of Generation Z are leveraging their grief and anger at the world they are likely to inherit and are urging fast and effective action - right now. Climate activists believe there is a role for the United Nations, with many attending a separate Youth Climate Summit at the UN on Saturday. But they are also urging direct action - including climate strikes - to shake people’s complacency and highlight that a catastrophe lies ahead unless carbon emissions are not drastically cut.

In the final part of our series tied to the Covering Climate Now initiative, we’ll meet young climate activists and thinkers who are battling to avert a global calamity.

2NuuadKm2ls,Climate Crisis in Vietnam | Jagravi Singh | TEDxYouth@AISVN,"The topic that I’m passionate to bring to this TedTalk is the climate crisis and what steps we can take to solve it or what are some signs of it getting solved. Also, how it is affecting people’s lives especially those living in coastal areas. I’ll be relating all this to the situation in Vietnam and giving clues as to how it is already happening.
My message to the audience is to care for your surroundings and take whatever little action to bring sustainability to our world! This can be through using bamboo straws, using more online documents rather than paper, riding a bicycle, using a biodegradable bag, or simply raising awareness!! All of these are definitely helpful steps for us to take care of our world as the temperatures are rising, floods occurring, and pollution becoming common.  I’m Jagravi Singh, a student at AAVN & currently in my junior year (Grade 11). Also, I’m an activist at the Local Globe Organization as well as believer of the global goals and supporter of the UN. I also enjoy participating in MUN debates. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This year has been rowdy, people have risen all over the globe in a wave of climate protests. We’ve had more and more talk of what actions to take, and more hope, despite the heat-waves, despite the fires and the destruction. But how should we teach, and learn, in a world affected by greenhouse gas emissions? In a world changed irrevocably, a world we need to steer into another direction? The climate crisis is our final exam.

We learn, we act, we stand for life. Join the next Global Climate Strike on 29 november. Consider following your local climate movement, supporting Fridays For Future, Extinction Rebellion, local & indigenous struggles.

Thunberg, 17, whose solo school strike in 2018 snowballed into a global youth movement, spoke out ahead of a UN event at which national leaders have been asked to increase their pledges on emissions cuts. In a video shared exclusively with the Guardian, she calls on leaders to account for failing to reverse rising carbon emissions, but concluded: ‘There is hope … we are the hope – we, the people'

vXlJEcrinwg,How empowering women and girls can help stop global warming | Katharine Wilkinson,"If we really want to address climate change, we need to make gender equity a reality, says writer and environmentalist Katharine Wilkinson. As part of Project Drawdown, Wilkinson has helped scour humanity's wisdom for solutions to draw down heat-trapping, climate-changing emissions: obvious things like renewable energy and sustainable diets and not so obvious ones, like the education and empowerment of women. In this informative, bold talk, she shares three key ways that equity for women and girls can help stop global warming. ""Drawing down emissions depends on rising up,"" Wilkinson says.

#climatechange #waterpollution #deforestation #greenenergy #workingmodel #scienceexhibition #sciencefair #scienceproject #diy #globalwarming #greenhouseeffect #greenenergy 

Global Warming:
Global warming refers to the long-term increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, primarily caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture, release greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) into the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect. 
As a result, more heat is trapped, leading to an overall warming of the planet.

Greenhouse Effect:
The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the Sun, preventing it from escaping back into space. 
These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, act like the glass panels of a greenhouse, allowing sunlight to enter but trapping heat inside. 
This process is essential for maintaining a habitable climate on Earth. However, human activities have significantly increased greenhouse gas concentrations, intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.

Green Energy:
Green energy, also known as renewable energy or clean energy, refers to energy sources that have minimal or no harmful impact on the environment and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. 
Green energy sources are considered sustainable and do not deplete finite resources.

Some common green energy sources include:

a) Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the Sun using solar photovoltaic (PV) cells or solar thermal systems.
b) Wind Energy: Energy generated from the kinetic energy of the wind using wind turbines.

x6zoUQqxM4Q,Why the climate crisis threatens our health | Nathan Hudson-Peacock | TEDxNHS,"Climate change poses the biggest threat to the future of our planet. But did you know, that climate change is also a health crisis? Nathan Hudson-Peacock shares his personal journey from expedition medic to eco medic. He shows us that protecting our planet is the best preventative medicine there is; and it's easy to do. Nathan is an emergency medicine doctor, expedition doctor and climate advocate. In 2019, Nathan embarked on a prolonged expedition to a remote part of the Himalayas, where he saw the real world impacts of the climate crisis on those who are contributing the least to environmental damage. His expedition medicine interests now focus on supporting ecological and environmental research groups and he has developed a passion for sustainable healthcare, founding the non-profit organisation, Eco Medics. Nathan is a firm believer that healthcare professionals have a moral and professional duty to be leading voices and pioneers in the global response to the climate crisis, and believes that the healthcare industry as a whole has the power to catalyse the societal shifts that need to happen if there is to be any hope of halting this environmental, social and health catastrophe.

CJVBvhNwqe4,The Countries with the Highest Carbon Emissions,"Graphic by The Hinrich Foundation and Visual Capitalist https://www.hinrichfoundation.com/research/wp/sustainable/global-carbon-markets/

The world emits over 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.
This graphic shows which countries have the highest emissions.

China alone accounts for nearly a third of global CO2, emitting over 11 billion tons.

Their annual emissions have more than tripled since the year 2000.
The USA and India are the second and third biggest polluters, with these three nations making up over half of the global total.

This shows how reducing emissions really comes down to a few major players.

The UK is the sixth largest economy in the world, and yet it contributes less than 1% of CO2 emissions.

You see, the island's massive ice cap is melting at an astonishing rate. And while that's got the scientists terrified, the locals are ecstatic. The big thaw is great news for tourism, fishing and farming. It hasn't been this warm since the Viking days, and Greenland has never been so green.

Zq4tHlgQLXg,Designing Humanity out of a Climate Crisis | Jonathan Mizzi | TEDxUniversityofMalta,"Jonathan Mizzi, Mizzi Studio Director, talks about humanity’s greatest challenge – the climate crisis – and how we can design our way out of it. Jonathan unpacks the legacy of our planet’s most pressing and pervasive episode: the twin catastrophe of climate change and biodiversity erosion. In diagnosing and tracing back to the root of the complex, multi-dimensional crisis, he surveys the role of technology, innovation and design throughout the history of the climate emergency, discussing the ways in which all three along with a paradigm shift to a circular economy are key to solving it.  
Drawing on experiences of both his personal life and life in practice, Jonathan oscillates between the ‘local’ and ‘global’ vis-à-vis the impact of a changing climate, illustrating the interconnectedness between the two scales whilst presenting adaptive multi-modal green infrastructure proposals and the resultant opportunities of rewilding our built environment. Designing Humanity out of a Climate Crisis is a talk that outlines both a problem and a plan. It’s underlying message: acknowledge hindsight, embrace hope, drive action. 
 Jonathan Mizzi is a Maltese-British architect and designer, who runs Mizzi Studio: a multidisciplinary practice specialising in Bioarchitecture and Biophilic design, dedicated to making the world a better place through inventive, climate-responsive design solutions.

Powered by optimism, driven by context, inspired by nature and science, and brought to life through ecologically friendly construction; the studio’s mission is to reconnect humanity with the natural world.
 
It is their pledge to Mother Nature to treat planet Earth as their primary client and their clients also include The Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, The Royal Parks and The Science Museum. Whether it be for respite, care, mobility or education, their work looks to inspire people to live environmentally socially responsible lives with a determined and positive spirit, fulfilling our time on earth with meaning and leaving it in a better place for the collective progress and prosperity of humanity and planet earth.

PDSpcBt9agY,Climate protection from moors | DW Documentary,"Peatlands bind more carbon than forests. But in Germany, almost all the country’s natural peatlands have been drained. Now, they’re emitting greenhouse gases. People around the world are currently working to rewet the moors - while keeping them usable for agriculture.

Dry peatlands are responsible for seven percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Taken together, all the moorland areas in Germany cover over 1.5 million hectares. However, much of this moorland has given way to pasture and arable land over the centuries. Drained, the moors lose their ability to store greenhouse gases. In Germany alone, they could store about as much carbon as the entire German forest - but they must remain wet.

Scientists Greta Gaudig and Sabine Wichmann from the ""Greifswald Moor Centrum” are working on a strategy to rewet the moors, while keeping them usable for agriculture. To accomplish this, they are testing the cultivation of peat mosses and cattails. These materials could be used to produce environmentally friendly potting soil and building materials. This way, farmers could continue generating income while saving the moors.

In Bristol, young entrepreneurs are producing a sustainable down substitute using cattails. With success: because the product is selling well, several farmers in England are converting their drained fields back to wet moorland for farming. For the first time, they have found a way to protect the moors and continue to make a living from their land.

--

While we’re already feeling the devastating effects of human-caused climate change, governments continue to fall short on making and executing emissions pledges that would help thwart further warming. So, what will our world look like in the next 30 to 80 years, if we continue on the current path? Shannon Odell offers a glimpse at Earth's possible future.

U1oII6txDYw,Gaza War Fuels Climate Crisis: “Massive” Carbon Emissions from Israeli Bombing,"Support our work: https://democracynow.org/give

Israel’s military assault on Gaza is not just a humanitarian disaster but also generating massive amounts of planet-heating emissions and exacerbating the climate crisis. The carbon emissions from Israel’s bombs, tanks, fighter jets and other military activity in the first two months of the war were higher than the annual carbon footprints of 20 of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, according to researchers in the United States and United Kingdom. That is “a really conservative estimate,” says Guardian reporter Nina Lakhani, who reported on the new study. We also speak with Hadeel Ikhmais, head of the climate change office at the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, who says the climate impacts of the war are in keeping with Israel’s destruction of Palestinian land, water and other natural resources over many decades.

bUchYgjpHGY,"Donald Trump, then and now: Climate change","On climate change, Donald Trump expressed doubt about the dangers presented by the warming global temperatures. He told a New Hampshire crowd in 2015 that he does think that the climate is changing, but he argued it's more naturally occurring. After getting elected, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords and his campaign promised to do so again if he is reelected. Speaking to supporters in New Hampshire in January, he promised a focus on more oil-drilling to help reduce energy costs. Furthermore, on the campaign trail this fall, Trump called climate change ""one of the great scams."" Scientists have roundly rejected claims like this, insisting that evidence shows the climate is changing and greenhouse gases from human activity are leading to rising temperatures.

L4dLlDpiXnA,New Study by Grok & Scientists Challenges CO2’s Role in Global Warming | Tom Nelson Pod #288,"About Jonathan Cohler: 
Graduated in 1980 from Harvard in Physics. Phi Beta Kappa. David McCord Prize.
Since the 2010s, I have guest lectured occasionally in the physics department at Harvard
Since the late 1990s, I have been keenly interested in the developing disinformation campaign often known as ""climate science."" I read extensively in this area.
In recent years, I have taken an interest in investigating so-called ""AI"" software, and the planned total take-over of public discourse by the big tech companies and their co-conspirators in our current government.

Dr. Willie Soon, an astrophysicist and geoscientist, is a leading authority on the relationship between solar phenomena and global climate. In this 32+ years of singular pursuit, he seeks to understand the Sun-Earth relations in terms of not only meteorology and climate, but also in terms of orbital dynamics of Sun-Earth-other planets interactions, magmatic (volcanoes) and tectonic (earthquakes) activities. His discoveries challenge computer modelers and advocates who consistently underestimate solar influences on cloud formation, ocean currents, and wind that cause climate to change. He has faced and risen above unethical and often libelous attacks on his research and his character, becoming one of the world's most respected and influential voices for climate realism. In 2018, he founded the Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences (CERES-science.com) in order to tackle a wider range of issues and topics without fears nor prejudices.

0DDEmtuU8mU,GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT OUR FAULT.   IT'S THEIR FAULT.,"Climate change duniya ka sabse bada crisis ban chuka hai, lekin problem ये है कि दुनिया एक साथ मिलकर इससे लड़ ही नहीं रही है।

इस वीडियो में हमने बताया है:
- क्यों दुनिया भर के देशों में cooperation की कमी है  
- कैसे बड़े-बड़े देशों की politics और economy इस मुद्दे को हल नहीं होने दे रही  
- और आखिर में, आम इंसान क्या कर सकता है?

Climate change से लड़ाई अकेले possible नहीं है — जब तक दुनिया एक साथ खड़ी नहीं होगी, तब तक कोई हल नहीं निकलेगा।

Thunberg's speech was an angry condemnation of world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change — “How dare you,” she said.

Learn more
Carbon emissions are the release of carbon compounds, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere. They are a major contributor to climate change and global warming: 
What causes carbon emissions
Human activities like industry, deforestation, and burning fossil fuels are the main causes of carbon emissions. 
How carbon emissions contribute to climate change
CO2 is a greenhouse gas that absorbs infrared radiation, which warms the planet. This warming has led to more severe storms, drought, and changing sea levels. 
How to reduce carbon emissions
Some ways to reduce carbon emissions include: 
Biking to work 
Using public transportation 
Driving an electric vehicle 
Eating less red meat and dairy 
Buying food produced locally 
Using a carbon footprint calculator 
You can calculate your carbon footprint using a carbon footprint calculator. These calculators can take into account the greenhouse gases you produce at home, while traveling, and in the production and transportation of the food and things you buy.",2024-12-16T14:05:34Z,UCYo6vwYNoyuVWKbNZPbB7jw,Data Dynamics,"['usa', 'usa carbon emission', '@usa', '#usacarbon', '#usa', 'total carbon emission', 'uk', 'germany', '#germany', '#uk', 'france', 'sweden', 'russia', 'russia carbon emission', 'Will emissions peak in 2024', 'What country has the highest carbon emissions', 'What are the carbon emissions in 2024', 'Which country produces the most carbon emissions in 2024', 'CO2 emissions by country per capita', 'Highest carbon emission by country 2024', 'Carbon emissions by country', 'Carbon emission by country 2024 europe']",1220,11,12,PT8M43S,28,none,2530,189,1059108

This video essay in the style of Jon Bois and BobbyBroccoli is about the history of climate change, and how John Sununu is the villain of the story, preventing a binding agreement on carbon emissions at the Noordwijk conference of 1989. Who is to blame for climate change? Who caused global warming? Why was John Sununu so important? These questions and more are answered in this video about the history of science and global warming.

Script:

I’m an atmospheric physicist. I’ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of “global warming” has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let’s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called—“climate change.” 

There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and the media. 

Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation’s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man’s burning of fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. 

Group two is made up of scientists who don’t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We’re usually referred to as skeptics. 

We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes—the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor.  

But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement:

1) The climate is always changing. 

2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.

3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 

4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 

5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that “The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”

uS0V31i_BhY,Polar Peril and the Methane Time Bomb,"Join us for a critical discussion with esteemed guest, Professor Peter Wadhams, a leading sea ice specialist, who shares insights into the alarming rise of methane emissions from both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Recent discoveries, such as methane releases from King George Island in Antarctica, highlight the urgency of addressing these emerging threats.

This video was recorded on March 19th, 2025, and published on March 30th, 2025, and represents the opinions of the discussion participants.

The conversation delves into the interconnectedness of climate systems, emphasizing how changes in the Arctic have far-reaching impacts on global weather patterns and ecosystems. Paul Beckwith, a climate system scientist, explains how Arctic temperature amplification affects planetary circulation, leading to extreme weather events. He also discusses recent research from Svalbard, where thermogenic methane emissions from glaciers are becoming a significant concern.

Peter Carter, a retired medical doctor and expert reviewer for the IPCC, underscores the critical role of methane in accelerating climate change. He highlights the irreversible nature of permafrost emissions and the cascading feedbacks in the Arctic, which are triggered at just 2°C of warming. The discussion emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate these catastrophic trends. Watch to learn more about the urgent challenges facing our planet and the imperative for collective action.

4HH5sWNYsFU,Synthetic Biology for Climate Action,"Connect with the Ginkgo Team, and tell us what you’re working on!

How are you using biology to address climate change? How can Ginkgo, our platform, and resources help you https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/contact-us/

Climate change is a global threat that requires immediate action. It’s already impacting every single person and living thing on our planet. The best time to address climate change was decades ago; the next best time is now. So, what are we waiting for? Let’s grow.

Limiting warming to below 1.5°C will require us to reimagine our industrial landscapes to eliminate emissions and to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. We believe that synthetic biology has an important role to play in this climate transition, whether it’s the resilience of ecosystems and communities to a changing climate, the reduction of emissions through circular manufacturing, or the sequestration of carbon through soil, oceanic, lithospheric, or anthropogenic sinks. 

This virtual event convened multiple speakers and audiences from the synthetic biology community, the climate tech VC community, thought leaders in ecosystem resilience, and more.

We’re galvanizing our community to come together and work collaboratively for the good of all living things. Join us to share your voice and work as we build a collaboration of technology developers, investors, and market facilitators responding to the climate emergency: https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/contact-us/",2022-02-25T18:48:44Z,UC5nD7FDcQ-5Kpw8r0a47d0w,Ginkgo Bioworks,[],6646,154,14,PT1H31M31S,28,none,5610,230,313383

vU8apbW6Dok,Could the Answer to Climate Change Lie Beneath Our Feet? | Meet the Finalists| XPRIZE Carbon Removal,"Episode 4 of the XPRIZE Carbon Removal docuseries explores effective land-based solutions for tackling climate change.

The Earth's biosphere has quietly regulated our climate for millions of years, with forests, grasslands, and soils playing a crucial role in absorbing and storing carbon. However, deforestation, soil degradation, and ecosystem destruction are weakening these natural defenses.

This episode showcases how five XPRIZE Carbon Removal finalist teams are working to restore and enhance these natural systems with groundbreaking land-based solutions.

Meet the teams:   

- Applied Carbon: Applied Carbon’s mobile technology converts crop residues into durable biochar on the move and in the field, making the economics work for farmers and our ecosystems. 

- MASH Makes: MASH Makes produces biochar and carbon-rich biofuels from cashew shell waste in India. These biofuels can potentially replace fossil fuels in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize.

- NetZero: NetZero focuses exclusively on the immense volumes of unused crop residues available in the tropics, and leverages their technology of mid-size, automated, highly optimized, and easily replicable pyrolysis plants.

- Takachar: Takachar’s mobile system uses pyrolysis to create biochar by heating agricultural biomass waste without oxygen.

- Vaulted Deep: Vaulted Deep utilizes wet organic waste in their carbon removal solution–including manure and municipal sewage that can be toxic for the environment. Vaulted Deep’s carbon removal solution turns this waste into a carbon-rich slurry, which is then injected deep underground in salt caverns between tiny cracks within the rock.

Learn how these land-based CDR solutions offer the promise of a more sustainable future by supporting farmers and communities and scaling globally.

J0ShpdiAkDQ,Forget Global Warming. A New ICE AGE Is Coming Sooner Than You Think!,"Forget Global Warming. A New ICE AGE Is Coming Sooner Than You Think!

For decades, the specter of global warming has dominated climate conversations, painting a picture of sweltering heatwaves, rising seas, and melting ice caps. But what if we’re looking at the wrong disaster? While the world scrambles to combat warming temperatures, an equally terrifying, yet largely overlooked possibility looms on the horizon: a new ice age. History tells us that ice ages are cyclical, and some scientists argue that Earth is overdue for its next deep freeze. They point to subtle shifts in solar activity, ocean currents, and natural cycles that could soon plunge our planet into a frozen epoch. Could this be our destiny? Are we approaching another ice age, and if so, what factors will set it into motion?

In a prime example of ecological engineering, the trees’ interlocking root system provides a net that prevents the soil from simply sliding down the slope during periods of heavy rain.

It all started in Gujarat, when a bird’s nest fell during road construction. The helpless bird’s pain moved Nair so deeply, he made a life-changing decision — to build a forest for the voiceless. 🕊💔  

Together with a friend, he bought land and used the Japanese Miyawaki Method to plant 1,450+ trees, creating a self-sustaining, fast-growing mini jungle! 🌳⚡  
His dedication caught the attention of the Maharashtra Government, who invited him to transform a dumping ground — where he planted 30,000 trees!  

Now, he has created over 105 dense forests across 12 Indian states!  

The most touching tribute? A special forest in memory of the Pulwama martyrs, where he planted 1,000 trees for each soldier. 🇮🇳  

Even though not many know his name, those who do salute him as the Green Hero of India!

A mysterious patch in the Pacific Ocean is defying all climate models - it is inexplicably cooling while the rest of the world is warming. Stretching off the west coast of Ecuador, this “cold tongue” challenges what we know about fundamental ocean and atmospheric currents, and has big implications for weather systems throughout the world. Can scientists crack the mystery of the Pacific Cold Tongue? Stay tuned to find out. 

Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.

6PUrw0J-224,New climate change performance index published | DW News,"Climate protection in some countries is improving. But the world's 61 biggest emitters are failing to take action needed to stick to 1.5 degrees Celcius warming, according to the latest Climate Change Performance Index.
Developments in renewable energy expansion, climate policy and a coal phase-out offer reasons to hope, but the pace of transformation is still worryingly slow and far behind what's required to stop runaway global heating, according to this year's Climate Change Performance Index.

The top three spots on the index remained empty again this year as not a single country is on a pathway to keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) — the Paris Agreement threshold for warming  — according to an assessment of 60 countries plus the EU, who are collectively responsible for 90% of global CO2 emissions. 

German-based NGO Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute, which supports countries to design, evaluate and implement sustainable energy policies, publish the index yearly as a way to compare countries' climate performance using common criteria. Scientists score nations based on CO2 emissions, the percentage of renewables in the energy mix, the pace of clean expansion, and what lawmakers are doing to implement climate change policy.

tj8ByiJb1vM,Natural Climate Solutions: Jan Timmermans on tackling the Climate Crisis,"Natural Climate Solutions are a vital part of the fight against the climate crisis, and we must act now to protect and restore nature for future generations. In this video, Jan Timmermans emphasizes the role nature plays in addressing climate challenges. Healthy ecosystems, like forests and wetlands, can help prevent disasters, cool cities, and restore balance to our environment.

Nature is not just an ally; it’s an essential partner in the battle against climate change. Natural Climate Solutions offer sustainable methods to combat the environmental issues we face, from floods to droughts. Protecting and restoring nature is not only urgent but also a responsibility we have to future generations.

We need to take immediate action, and politicians, adults, and young people must work together to drive change. The EU is committed to supporting Natural Climate Solutions as part of its broader environmental and climate strategy. It’s not too late to make a difference—let's ensure a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren.

Join us as we explore how Natural Climate Solutions can help tackle the climate crisis and the responsibility we all share in safeguarding the planet.

#globalwarming #workingmodel #sciencefair #sciencemodel #scienceexhibition #workingproject #scienceproject #howtofunda 

Short explanation : 

Global warming is a complex phenomenon that involves the increase in the Earth's surface temperature due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space, causing the Earth's surface temperature to rise.

The increase in global temperature has a range of consequences, including rising sea levels, melting of glaciers and sea ice, changes in precipitation patterns, more frequent and severe weather events, and ecosystem disruptions. These changes have significant implications for human health, agriculture, and infrastructure.

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, are the primary cause of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, while deforestation reduces the ability of trees to absorb carbon dioxide. Agriculture contributes to emissions through livestock production and the use of fertilizers.

To mitigate the impacts of global warming, it is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. This can be achieved through a range of measures, including investing in renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, promoting public transportation, and reducing deforestation.

sucsG1Dg8XA,Climate justice – understand a key pillar of climate action,"We live in an era of extraordinary climate injustice. 

The impacts of the climate crisis are deepening already existing vulnerabilities and inequalities within and across generations, communities and countries worldwide. Low-income, marginalised, discriminated and disenfranchised groups are disproportionately affected. Climate hazards, shocks and stresses are becoming more frequent and severe as global heating accelerates. 

Industrialised, wealthy countries do not live up to their historical and current responsibilities. The responsibility for the climate crisis is unevenly distributed. 

Climate justice is a movement that calls for a rapid, just transition to a low-carbon world – a transition that boosts human rights rather than undermines them.

lPl1VhStirE,"Why protecting animal migrations could help the planet - The Climate Question, BBC World Service","From wildebeest in the Serengeti to sharks in the sea, climate change is altering animal migrations. It's not just impacting the wildlife but our fight against climate change itself.

Click here to subscribe to our channel 👉🏽 https://bbc.in/3VyyriM

Every year, the great migration sees hundreds of thousands of wildebeest, gazelles, zebras and antelopes migrate from the Serengeti plains in Tanzania to Kenya's Maasai Mara in search of water and juicy grass.

But rising temperatures and unpredictable weather are changing this epic animal journey dramatically. It’s the same for great white sharks, which are being spotted in areas where they’d never normally live.

Tanzanian safari guide Neema Amos takes us into the Serengeti to explain why the wildebeest migration is so important. And shark expert Trisha Atwood reveals how these changes affect not just the animals, but our fight against climate change itself.

XozRD4pWBMk,"Climate crisis at 'tipping point', scientists warn | ITV News","""We're in a state of planetary emergency,"" not the words of breathless campaigners protesting on the streets, or even environment correspondents like me, screaming in their wellies, but a team of distinguished scientists writing in one of the world's leading science journals.

A decade ago, Professor Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter coined the phrase ""planetary tipping points"" to describe parts of the Earth's interconnected systems that in the past had been pushed from one state, past an irreversible point, into another.

EZanGekES-E,"Carbon emissions and grocery shopping: EVs and home delivery better, ‘trip chaining’ and robots best","The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way grocery stores do business, with online sales rising more than 50% from 2019 to 2020 in the United States.

As shoppers searched for safe and convenient ways to get essential items, grocers adapted to meet increased e-commerce demand. Small, automated warehouses called micro-fulfillment centers—often located within existing stores—enabled grocers to fill pickup orders more quickly, sometimes within an hour of order placement.

At the same time, ongoing advances with autonomous vehicles, robots and drones promise to create new consumer options in the near future.

So, how will all these changes affect the amount of climate-altering greenhouse gases generated by grocery shopping? Which alternatives produce the most and the least heat-trapping emissions, and what can consumers do to minimize their carbon footprint?

C4lAU9qXRXw,"Tutorials - Jessica Greene, Chioma Onyekpere: Monitoring carbon emissions: making the impact...","Full title: Tutorials - Monitoring carbon emissions: making the impact of your python code visible

Presented by:
Jessica Greene (she/her)
Chioma Onyekpere (She/Her)

“If the Internet was a country, it would be the 4th largest polluter” [1] The power to make impactful change through technology has never been greater. Doing so starts with understanding the problem space. Our workshop will guide you through the process of quantifying the emissions of your Python code and integrating this awareness into your monitoring strategy.

Starting with the basics of observability, an essential part of operating a deployed service, you’ll learn why it’s important to monitor your Python code, what makes a good metric, and the common pitfalls to avoid. We’ll then dive into the practical aspects of exposing and creating custom metrics, scraping and storing them in Prometheus, a time series database, and then visualising them in dashboards using Grafana.

The workshop will also include an overview of climate-conscious tech, discussing the tech industry’s contribution to the climate crisis and introducing the principles of green coding. We’ll explore techniques and libraries for extracting metrics for carbon awareness, because ""If you can't measure it, you can't improve it."" (Peter Drucker) and guide attendees through a practical session on instrumenting your Python code for carbon emissions and visualizing this data.

By attending this workshop, you’ll gain valuable insights and hands-on experience in making your code more carbon-conscious. You’ll learn about carbon-aware workloads, strategies for making your services more energy, and carbon efficient, the importance of cloud provider regions and transparency, and how to advocate for change. These skills and knowledge can be integrated into your day-to-day work, making a real difference in our world.

Join us in this journey towards a more sustainable future in tech and a better planet for everyone.

VsOJR40M0as,How to Find Joy in Climate Action | Ayana Elizabeth Johnson | TED,"We can all play a role in the climate movement by tapping into our skills, resources and networks in ways that bring us satisfaction, says climate leader Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. She suggests drawing a Venn diagram to map these questions: What are you good at? What is the work that needs doing? And what brings you joy? Where your answers intersect is where you should put your climate action effort. “Averting climate catastrophe: this is the work of our lifetimes,” Johnson says.

qVv8_nQ75t8,What can you do with captured carbon emissions?,"Carbon capture is essential for the UK to play its part and lead the world in avoiding the climate crisis
BUT instead of just capturing and storing it, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be useful. Here are 5 things that can be made from captured carbon: 
1. Bubbles in pints
CO2 can be used to add the fizz to beer and soft drinks 
2. Smarter sneakers 
75% of the materials used to make The Shoe Without A Footprint are from captured emissions
3. Better plastics 
CO2 can be turned into oil-free alternatives to plastic including polyols used to make polyurethanes in
cars sofas fridges buildings and clothing
4. Cleaner concrete
Concrete is emissions-intensive to make Capturing CO2 from the process and reusing it in production 
locks in emissions rather than releasing them 
5. Fish Food
A UK startup is using captured carbon to create protein-based feed for aquiculture and agriculture

Kb2fdnpg5Ww,The Oedipus Project: Climate Crisis,"The Oedipus Project presents acclaimed actors reading scenes from Sophocles’ Oedipus the King on Zoom as a catalyst for powerful, constructive, global conversations about climate change,  ecological disaster, and environmental justice. Sophocles’ ancient play, first performed in 429 BC, just after a plague that killed nearly one-third of the Athenian population, is a story of arrogant leadership, ignored prophecy, intergenerational curses, willful blindness, and a pestilence and ecological collapse that ravages the archaic city of Thebes. Seen through this lens, Oedipus the King appears to have been a powerful tool for helping Athenians communalize trauma and loss, while interrogating their own complicit role in the suffering, not just of those around them but of generations to come. 

This free, live, public event was presented on April 27th, 2021 as part of the Nobel Prize Summit: Our Planet, Our Future, hosted by the Nobel Foundation and organized by the U. S. National Academy of Sciences in partnership with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and the Stockholm Resilience Centre/Beijer Institute. 

Featuring performances by Bill Murray, Corey Hawkins,  Frances McDormand, Jeffrey Wright,  Frankie Faison, David Strathairn, Marjolaine Goldsmith, Jumaane Williams, and a Chorus of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, including Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn and Dr. Harold Varmus.

I-fJGMRpNEA,"Why 1.5°C is a ""geologically significant"" level of global warming","#Climate scientist Daniel Swain ( @WeatherWest ) discusses why 1.5°C of #globalwarming is so immensely consequential for human and natural systems on Earth. 1.5°C may seem like a small temperature difference in a particular location on any given day, since it's likely less than the difference between today's and tomorrow's weather. But to put these numbers into perspective: the difference between recent Earth temperatures and the peak of the last Ice Age--when there were thousands of feet of ice (twice the height of a modern skyscraper) covering places that are today home to cities like New York and Chicago--was only around 6.0°C.

The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.

GToYyJeq4R8,Explained: Australia’s carbon emissions,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has claimed Australia is “meeting and beating” its emissions reductions targets – Sky News Australia has drilled into Australia’s emissions reduction story to see if this checks out.  
  
Emissions reduction targets worldwide are calculated using 2005 as a baseline level, with Australia’s emissions having reduced 19.8 per cent from 2005 levels.  
  
However, Australia calculates emissions, including land clearing, which has attracted some controversy: around exactly how it’s counted, whether it is a true transition of the economy, and the fact Australia uses land clearing figures more than other nations. 
  
Land clearing involves not clearing as much land and allowing the land to soak up carbon, whether by soil capture or using it as a carbon sink.  
  
Australia’s emissions have only reduced by 2.7 per cent if land clearing isn’t included in the emissions total – meaning land clearing plays a huge role in Australia’s emissions targets.",2021-10-28T06:13:01Z,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,Sky News Australia,"['6279134779001', 'business', 'energy', 'fb', 'msn', 'yt']",1324,18,18,PT4M51S,25,none,5480000,186023,6205475458

CU8PQpE4c0A,How Donald Trump has approached climate change over the years #newhampshire #donaldtrump,"On climate change, Trump has long expressed doubt about the dangers presented by the warming global temperatures. He told a New Hampshire crowd in 2015 that he does think that the climate is changing, but he argued it's more naturally occurring.

After getting elected, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords and his campaign promised to do so again if he is reelected.

Speaking to supporters in New Hampshire in January, he promised a focus on more oil-drilling to help reduce energy costs.

Furthermore, on the campaign trail this fall, Trump called climate change ""one of the great scams.""

Scientists have roundly rejected claims like this, insisting that evidence shows the climate is changing and greenhouse gases from human activity are leading to rising temperatures.

o9OzTz91WK4,Our Climate Future | Short film,"The effects of climate change are being felt around the world and are already having an impact on Aotearoa New Zealand.

The food we eat, the way we travel, and the goods and services we produce all emit greenhouse gases. These emissions can stay in the atmosphere for decades to centuries or longer. Our annual average temperature continues to increase, especially in winter. New Zealand’s annual average temperature rose at a rate of 0.31°C per decade over the past 30 years.

We need to talk about climate change, its effect on New Zealand communities, and what actions we can take individually and collectively to limit its impact.

The decisions we make today will shape the lives of future generations. Let’s create a better climate future.

To make the world a better place, you need more reliable, affordable, secure, energy,” Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy, told Forbes, 10 days before President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate him as the next secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy. And that’s true, he says, even if the world has to rely on fossil fuels to get there.

Jackson Carpenter has ten years’ experience working on solutions to climate change and the development of alternative fuels. He is a climate writer and member of the Collider in Asheville, NC, collaborating with scientists and businesses to address climate change. He is a coauthor of the Collider’s Business of Climate Report, and his upcoming book Carbon retells the story of climate change from a unique perspective that illuminates the commonsense solutions at our fingertips.

-FUF4WvaLoc,Is funding and political support for combatting the climate crisis drying up? | DW News,"An independent group of scientists monitoring climate change says that there's been no progress on lowering the forecast for global warming, for a third year in a row. Their warning comes as countries are gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the annual UN-sponsored climate talks. The focus at this year's COP29 is on setting new financial goals to help developing countries cope with the effects of climate change.  Bangladesh's new leader Muhammad Yunus slammed rich countries responsible for decades of carbon emissions, for not being willing to pay their fair share. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels reached a record high in 2023, the UN is warning that 2024 is the first year the world has cracked the 1.5 degree global warming target set in the Paris Agreement. What's the point of COP if there seems to be no political will to make the changes we need to avoid a climate catastrophe? DW speaks with Jennifer Morgan, German State Secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Policy.

Each of the nations and the European Commission list their financial commitments to vaccine sharing, defeating poverty, and defending the planet. 
Global Citizen Live calls for action to halt climate change and for wealthy countries to deliver on the $100B climate pledge, $6B for famine relief, and COVID-19 vaccine justice for all. On Sept. 25, 2021, over 60M COVID-19 vaccines, 157M trees, and more than US$1.1B in commitments to climate, famine, and COVID-19 response efforts were announced as part of the partner-led campaign. The Global Citizen Live campaign continues in the lead-up to the G20 Summit and the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) later this year.

54YUSR2qJPM,Climate Action That (Actually) Fits Your Life,"The climate crisis can feel overwhelming a lot of the time, and while many of us want to get started on saving the planet, it can be hard to know how. Which is understandable. Individual actions can feel small in the face of one of the most complex problems humanity has ever faced, which has major systemic issues, and goals that are constantly being shifted–or outright ignored.
 
Rather than feel despondent or stuck, there are things you can do to get started. Things that are simple and free–but also make a real difference. Ecosia is one of them. 

Ecosia started out as a tree planting search engine, but has evolved into a climate impact powerhouse. Thanks to 20 million people like you, we’re tackling the climate crisis from every angle to create real, lasting change. Now when you use Ecosia, you’re also helping to protect wildlife, create renewable energy, and invest in climate impact initiatives across the globe. 

The beauty of Ecosia is that all of this wide-ranging climate action integrates effortlessly and seamlessly into your day-to-day life. You use the internet every day, so why not fund climate action and plant trees while you do so? With Ecosia you can change the planet without having to change your life.

Global politics are in upheaval right now, but the climate crisis remains constant, and Ecosia’s values and actions have stayed steadfast. Like the fact that we can’t be bought—our founder and CEO Christian has given up his right to ever sell or profit from Ecosia. Plus we run on proof, not promises. We use 100% of our profits for the planet—and we tell you all about it. No secrets here! We also help you protect what you love, with people all around the world. The global Ecosia community is making a real difference, whether it’s planting native trees, building renewable energy, or saving endangered wildlife.

As governments are rolling back climate protections all over the globe, we’re putting the power to fight the climate crisis back in your hands. So if you’re not using Ecosia already, consider giving it a try this Earth Day—it only takes 30 seconds. And if you’re already making a difference with us (thank you!) why not share our Earth Day video with your friends. The first step is often the hardest, but if you can help others get started, we can grow our impact for our shared home, together.

PULbm9z630I,"Global National: June 9, 2022 | Canada, California partners on climate action, critics unimpressed","On this episode of Global National: At the Summit of Americas in Los Angeles, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a pact to fight climate change. David Akin reports on what's part of the agreement, and why critics are slamming it as just more talk and less action.

Despite making climate pledges, the federal government approved the Bay du Nord oil project off Newfoundland and Labrador's coast in April. As Ross Lord explains, the decision is spawning questions about whether the federal and provincial Liberal governments are moving in opposite directions on the environment.

In Washington, the committee investigating the January 6th siege on the U.S. Capitol is using its first public hearing airing on prime time television to prove former president Donald Trump's role in the riot. Jackson Proskow speaks with Metropolitan Police Department Officer Daniel Hodges, who was crushed by the violent mob, about what he hopes to get out of the hearings.

After a scathing report highlighting rampant sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, recent social media comments by Maj.-Gen. Simon Bernard, the head of human resources, are raising questions about the military's commitment to changing its culture. As Mercedes Stephenson explains, Maj.-Gen. is now apologizing.

And Russia's devastating war in Ukraine is dealing a heavy toll on the global food supply chain, as the conflict keeps vital goods from being exported. Dan Spector explains how the war is fuelling famine around the world, and how some countries are responding.

In couple of decades you will still have two choices. To live in a city flooded with rising sea water, or a place where drought hasn’t ended in years. You can choose to live in a place infected with viral chronic diseases, or a place where everyone is fighting for basic human needs. You can choose either a forest fire, or a hurricane. A sudden steep drop of temperature within 24 hours, or a prolonged heat waves. In a couple of decades you will not have a choice of a better planet, but you do now.

Thunberg came to the talks after a trip to meet with climate leaders across North America in anticipation of the scheduled climate conference in Santiago, Chile, before the talks were abruptly moved to the Spanish capital. In her address, Thunberg warned that the planet’s carbon budget is down to just eight years, and urged bold action. “I still believe that the biggest danger is not inaction. The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” Thunberg said.

ZHb9_ZH5C-s,The ocean helps absorb our carbon emissions. We may be pushing it too far #Shorts,"The ocean plays a massive role in keeping Earth's climate in check. One particular marine layer, known as the twilight zone, is key to moving carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and into the depths of the ocean.
One way that happens involves a long, daily trek made by countless species that call the twilight zone home. At night, fish and other creatures make their way thousands of meters up toward the surface to feed on microscopic plants that spent the day soaking up sunlight and carbon dioxide. While they do so, predators take the opportunity to hunt down smaller prey. Thus begins a chain of carbon transfer — from phytoplankton to tiny fish to squid, for example.
At sunrise, the creatures make their way back to the twilight zone to hide from predators until repeating the process the next evening.
“It is this huge, coordinated dance that all of these organisms go on every single day,” said Morgan Raven, an organic geochemist and geobiologist at the University of California Santa Barbara.
Some of the carbon — like waste from the animals or decaying bodies — drifts toward the bottom of the ocean where it can stay for ""centuries to millennia,"" according to a new report from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
Yet in the face of indiscriminate fossil fuel use, scientists warn that this dazzling daily marine show and the many other ways that the ocean helps take in our excess carbon emissions is at significant risk of disruption due to the myriad threats of climate change.

Ldx1JYXVzMU,Can we trust governments to tackle the climate emergency? | The Stream,"On Friday, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said if carbon emissions are not scaled back, the world will continue to be on a ""catastrophic pathway"" toward 2.7 degree Celsius heating. But is the threat of even more dangerous levels of global warming enough to finally convince governments into making the ambitious changes necessary to avoid a further climate catastrophe?

In the latest warning from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say that unabated greenhouse gas emissions are pushing global temperatures and sea levels up faster than expected. An effective global response will require the world's richest countries to commit to significant reductions in burning fossil fuels.

The UN is using this week’s General Assembly meeting to build momentum on climate action ahead of November’s COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. Also central to the UN's agenda is ""climate financing"" for smaller countries that may be struggling to adapt to climate change. 

But governments of the world's largest economies are all still failing to meet commitments made in 2015 during the landmark Paris climate change agreement.

In the first of three shows in partnership with the UN General Assembly, we'll discuss how governments are responding to climate change. Does the political will exist for a multilateral solution to the climate emergency?

gV7A5LDLiG4,Ken Kimmell | Lessons from the COVID Crisis for the Climate Crisis | Talks at Google,"Ken Kimmell explores the lessons we have learned from the COVID-19 crisis, and the implications for spurring action on climate change.

Today, there is an urgent need to address climate change. The recent fires in California are just one example of this. At the same time, we are still facing the COVID-19 pandemic. There are strong similarities between these two global challenges and during this talk, we’ll discuss -- are we learning any lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic that can help us mobilize to address climate change?

Ken Kimmell is President of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a leading science-based nonprofit that combines the knowledge and influence of the scientific community with the passion of concerned citizens to build a healthy planet and a safer world. Mr. Kimmell has more than 30 years’ experience in government, environmental policy, and advocacy.

Overheated rhetoric has politicized and misinformed the public about the earth’s climate. S. Fred Singer’s classic 1997 book on global warming—and antidote to alarmism—""Hot Talk, Cold Science"" has been updated and expanded, incorporating numerous recent scientific findings, making this fascinating and complex subject accessible to general readers.

Merging recent developments in science, economics, and public policy, ""Hot Talk, Cold Science,"" is a much-needed, peer-reviewed, de-coding book to a sprawling, highly technical literature, giving readers a clear understanding of what scientists and policymakers know about climate change—and what they don’t. The book allows independent thinkers to better detect and reason beyond the hyperbole and propaganda all-too-common in the politics and media coverage of this heated subject.

""Indiscreet comments made by an Exxon Mobil lobbyist to undercover activists may figure prominently in upcoming congressional hearings about the role of oil companies in the battle against climate change.

Video clips released by the Greenpeace investigation project Unearthed show Keith McCoy, the oil giant's senior director for federal relations, talking frankly about Exxon Mobil's lobbying strategies. Channel 4 from the United Kingdom first reported the comments.

McCoy was tricked by the activists who said they were job recruiters. He talked about working with ""shadow groups,"" supporting a carbon tax that he believes will never happen and influencing senators to weaken climate elements of President Biden's infrastructure plan.""

The focus of this year's meeting is on climate financing. Developing countries are seeking assurances they'll get more funding to deal with the impact of climate catastrophes - that are becoming more severe and more frequent.

What are you waiting for? Hello friends, we're very happy to present the first episode of our series ""Children can make a WORLD of difference"" in which our planet Earth will tell us some worrying things about Climate Change and how our everyday actions can help her alleviate this situation. 

Hello, do you know who I am? I am the Earth, yes this very planet and I would like to talk to you about a couple of things which worry me and should upset you, too. 

If you were to join me in an elevator, do you know what I would tell you? That I am hot, very very hot. This is because of Climate Change, which is something that human beings have a big responsibility for. 

Every time you turn on the light, the computer, the microwave o even shower, you are consuming energy. This energy is produced, largely, by burning gases, coal, or petroleum, which are known as fossil fuels. When burning them you are sending off tons and tons and tons of gases into my atmosphere. These gases remain in the atmosphere forming a type of roof which withholds heat. This is called the “greenhouse effect” because a Greenhouses is where one can cultivate plants, and the roof does not allow heat to escape, and I am getting hotter and hotter.

¿Do you want to know how you can help me change this situation? Go to Happy Learning's website and watch the whole video.

You've probably heard of climate tipping points, those thresholds we REALLY don't want to hit. But not all climate tipping points are negative. In fact there are some that we would REALLY like to hit. And scientists have identified the policies that can get us there.

Erratum: In the video I mistakenly claim that EVs in Norway outnumber vehicles powered by fossil fuels - as the source on screen correctly states, they just outnumber *petrol* powered vehicles. They will likely outnumber diesel cars in the next few years.

This video is about climate tipping points, just the climate tipping points scientists want us to hit. The good news is: we have either already hit these tipping points or are going to hit them soon with targeted policies that scientists have identified. Watch this video to feel better about climate change and our response to it.

Y5sn-jMBUlg,Should rich countries pay the bill for global warming?,"Since industrialization began, developed countries have contributed the vast majority of the world’s carbon emissions and got rich in the process. Poorer countries, on the other hand, have contributed little to the climate crisis, but are set to feel the worst effects. Many of those developing nations want help -- in the form of money. But getting governments to agree to those measures is going to be difficult.

eHMLszamZ9w,What is climate change?,"1. Episode: What is climate change and is it real?

Climate Change is the bad news story that isn’t going away 
From heatwaves to hurricanes, from droughts to floods
Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, putting lives at risk
Human activity is causing our climate to change
The CO2 emissions from our cars, our industries and our power plants are heating up the planet
To prevent further dangerous levels of climate change
Countries around the world signed up to the Paris Agreement
The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees
To stop the planet getting warmer, we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels
And increase the share of renewable energy, like from wind, solar and low carbon sources
Climate action is everyone‘s responsibility: governments, businesses, communities, individuals 
The actions we can take to reduce our carbon footprint, like investing in green technologies can also reduce costs and create jobs
The risks and costs of inaction are too high to ignore. 
So what are we waiting for? The time to act is now.

Hurricane Helene and Milton are painful reminders that our oceans are changing. Warmer ocean waters are acting on higher sea levels, causing catastrophic damage to our coastal communities. And what’s scarier is that the sea level rise we’ve witnessed over the past 30 years is nothing compared to what we’ll see in our lifetimes. 

In this episode, we take a peek at brand-new flood imagery created by Climate Central’s FloodVision team - imagery that shows just what our coastal communities will look like in 2050, 2100 and beyond. And we’ll uncover detailed maps showing just what our coastlines will look like as the seas rise. So stay tuned to see if your home is on these maps, and what we can do to lessen the impacts in the future.

Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.

D-Xg0HrMof0,T2 - Carbon emissions vs renewables targets,"Should you set yourself a carbon emissions or renewable energy target?

There are many ways targets can be set. In the context of climate change mitigation, the most common targets relate to either carbon emissions or renewable energy. 

Carbon reduction targets can be in absolute or relative terms. For instance, you could set yourself an absolute reduction target of 40% by 2025 from the 2020 baseline. You could also set yourself a relative reduction target, which measures your reduction activities against a figure like your production output, staff numbers, operating hours or square metres. An example would be ‘achieve a 50% reduction of your carbon emissions/Full Time Equivalent by 2023 from your 2018 baseline’.

Renewable energy targets are usually expressed as the percentage of energy you would like to source from renewable energy. For example, you could have a goal for your organisation to be ‘50% renewable by 2023’, or '100% renewable by 2025'.

In my next video, I'll talk about what you should include within the scope of your target.

iQuwhR99YdA,"Extreme weather, rising sea levels, devastating floods - The global climate crisis | DW Documentary","Extreme weather is occurring more frequently worldwide. Rising sea levels and heavy rain are causing devastating floods. Most researchers agree that these are the consequences of climate change. But what can we do to protect ourselves?

In July 2021, the Ahr Valley in western Germany was hit by a flash flood after heavy rainfall. Over 100 people were killed, thousands of homes were severely damaged.  Experts are calling it the ‘flood of the century’. Yet extreme weather events such as the Ahr Valley floods have become more frequent in recent years - not only in Germany but worldwide. Mozambique has been hit by devastating cyclones for the third year running.  In Bangladesh, the monsoon season has become heavier and more unpredictable due to climate change. More and more land has been flooded as a result.  At the same time, heavy storms that cause flooding and rising sea levels threaten the south of the country. Experts estimate that 30 per cent of Bangladesh will be permanently flooded in a few years, making millions of people climate refugees. 
 
Wealthy countries such as Germany are now investing billions in the battle against the floods. The Netherlands have long pioneered in flood management, building powerful pumping stations, ever higher dikes and flood barriers.  None of these options are available to poor countries. All they can do, along with improving early flood warning systems, is to resettle the people affected. The film ‘Global Climate Crisis - How to Tackle the floods?’ shows the unequal fight against the consequences of climate change with examples from Germany, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and Mozambique.

WZzMAuBtBeU,"""Climate crisis is a code red for humanity"" - UN Chief | United Nations | Climate Action","Speaking at a high-level meeting on climate action, UN chief Antonio Guterres said that the climate crisis is a code red for humanity, adding that “the time has passed for diplomatic niceties,” and “if governments do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering.”

Speaking at a meeting on Delivering Climate Action - for People, Planet & Prosperity today (26 Oct) in New York, Guterres said, “Businesses need to reduce their climate impact, and fully and credibly align their operations and financial flows to a net-zero future. No more excuses. No more greenwashing.”

He added, “investors — public and private alike — must do the same. They should join front runners like the net-zero asset owners alliance, and the UN’s own pension fund, which met its 2021 carbon reduction investment objectives ahead of time and above its target, with a 32 per cent reduction this year.”

The UN chief also said, “individuals in every society need to make better, more responsible choices — in what they eat, how they travel, and what they purchase as consumers.”

He also reiterated “young people — and climate activists — need to keep doing what they’re doing: demanding action from their leaders.”

Guterres also said, “throughout, we need global solidarity to help all countries make this shift,” adding that “developing countries are grappling with debt and liquidity crises. They need support. Public and multilateral development banks must significantly increase their climate portfolios and redouble their efforts to help countries transition to net-zero, resilient economies.”

The UN chief continued, “the developed world must urgently meet its commitment of at least $100 billion in annual climate finance for developing countries. I repeat my call to donors and multilateral development banks to devote at least 50 per cent of their climate support towards adaptation and resilience in the developing world.”

Surangel Whipps Jr., President of Palau also addressed the Assembly. He said, “the ocean, climate, biodiversity nested demanded and amplified the global response to climate change.”

He reiterated, “we need radical accountability to NDC commitments, and radical strategies to achieve net carbon-zero by 2050. All countries must step up.”

Jacinda Arden, the Prime Minister of New Zealand said, “New Zealand is using every opportunity to build a sheer approach in areas that are critical importance, ending fossil fuel subsidies, shifting finance away from environmentally harmful forms and building climate actions into trading arrangements.”

She continued, “our efforts within countries and together to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic must be used as an opportunity to accelerate clean and sustainable transformation.”

The Prime Minister called on the leaders of Asia-Pacific to “demonstrate unity and to champion a climate resilient future.”

The high-level meeting focused on the gap between current and required technical, skilling and financial capacities to achieve the 1.5 degrees target and how that gap can be met, through showcasing best practices that simultaneously address climate action and the myriad structural challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. It also took stock of the ambition-raising initiatives from Member States and stakeholders made along the path to COP26 and help identify areas and sectors where more can be done. Participants are invited to focus on encouraging State Parties and other key stakeholders, including industry and the private sector, to increase ambition across key areas, including, first, identify and present solutions towards meeting the technical, financial and skills gaps to achieve the 1.5 temperature goal. Second, Build momentum for partnerships on technical and resource support. Third, increasing political support for climate finance, especially on adaption, on the scale and at the pace that is needed for sustainable recovery.

Hk3GZMz-b88,"George Monbiot on Journalism, Politics and the Climate Crisis","Describing the environmental crisis as the greatest challenge humankind has ever confronted, George Monbiot has been trying to raise the profile of a wide range of desperately neglected environmental issues for the last 37 years. Yet these issues are almost always marginalised and overlooked. Despite it often feeling like banging his head against a wall, he refuses to stop trying, however faint the hope, to alert people to the scale and nature of this emergency. In July, he was awarded the Orwell Prize for Journalism 2022.

Join him at UCL, Bloomsbury, on Thursday 13th October for a conversation with Helen Hawkins, a former arts editor at The Sunday Times and a judge for this year's Orwell Prize, as they discuss his Orwell Prize-winning pieces, from 'Capitalism is Killing the Planet' to the myth of 'Green growth'. 

George Monbiot is an author, Guardian columnist and environmental activist. His best-selling books include Feral: Rewilding the land, sea and human life, Heat: how to stop the planet burning, and Out of the Wreckage: a new politics for an age of crisis. George co-wrote the concept album Breaking the Spell of Loneliness with musician Ewan McLennan, and has made a number of viral videos. George’s latest book, Regenesis: Feeding the World without Devouring the Planet, was published in May 2022.",2022-10-14T14:30:44Z,UCLXxMwgTqOdg8g8Q-Uhigqw,The Orwell Foundation,"['#orwellprize', '#climatecrisis', '#journalism', '#climate', '#georgeorwell', '#monbiot', '#journalismprize']",5865,155,31,PT1H32M56S,25,none,2820,644,520328

LzuE2qkUMsQ,Australia: The Coming Climate Hell,"Australia, one of the most beautiful countries on the planet, is also one of the most polluting. From fires and droughts to cyclones and floods, the country is no stranger to bearing the full brunt of global warming.

According to the Brown To Green Report – an annual review detailing G20 member countries’ performance in environmental matters – Australia is one of the worst performing members from the board on almost all counts: deforestation, coal mining, excessive water consumption, and carbon footprint. Despite this, the Australian government continues to encourage the production of coal, and it is one of the world’s leading exporters of this fossil fuel. Most elected officials in the country are climate skeptics. Green energy is not a priority. And the media fails to address the crisis.

Whilst exploring the Australian desert, we decided to meet the present-day cowboys of the Outback, who live on isolated ranches located hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest village. They spend most of their time searching for water. We also met the miners of Australia’s booming coal industry – who were keen to not only defend their field, but also the way of life it comes with.

However, there has recently been an increase awareness of the climate crisis and people have started to take action. Among them, Aboriginal communities who have always protected and reclaimed nature, as well as activists who do not hesitate to openly criticise polluting companies. But a number of Australian states have adopted strict laws that threaten the right to peaceful protests, leading to numerous protesters running the risk of being put behind bars for their fight against climate change.

gzTxlQGbiyc,Rivers at risk - Water crisis on four continents | DW Documentary,"Water is scarce, but global demand continues to rise. Humanity is facing serious disputes over our most important resource. What impact is our lifestyle having on our planet's water cycles?

Along six rivers on four continents, the documentary explores the question of why this vital resource, water, is becoming increasingly scarce - and who’s responsible. 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture. And a large proportion of this goes into the production of animal feed. Our excessive meat consumption is partly to blame for the fact that mighty rivers such as the Spanish Ebro or the Colorado in the USA and Mexico are drying up. Factory farming businesses are worth billions to major agricultural companies, but this overuse of water often goes hand in hand with its pollution. Europe has outsourced its dirtiest industries to countries such as India. Around 20 per cent of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry. The film provides rare insights into Indian factories and life in the places where contaminants are discharged.

But it’s not all bad news. In the film, we also meet people who’ve come up with solutions. In France, dams are dismantled to revitalize rivers; in an Egyptian oasis the inhabitants experiment with hydroponics; and in India, an individual known as the ""water man” uses a millennia-old technique to coax rivers from deserts that dried up decades ago.

oxZyKGLJaaM,"Managing farm dams to reduce carbon emissions ,improving biodiversity & water security","Managing farm dams to reduce carbon emissions ,improving biodiversity & water security with Dr Martino Malerba
Farm dams are the most abundant type of freshwater wetland in Australia. Farm dams are also among the highest greenhouse gas emitters of all freshwater ecosystems, producing the equivalent of 385,000 cars each day in Victoria alone.

In this 1 hour webinar presentation, Dr Martino Malerba, a senior environmental scientist at Deakin Uni.’s Blue Carbon Lab, will discuss how farms can be managed to reduce carbon emissions whilst improving biodiversity and water security.

Dr Malerba manages the Teal Carbon group at Deakin Uni.’s Blue Carbon Lab, which focuses on the sustainable management of freshwater systems and leads an interdisciplinary research team to quantify the scale of these emissions, explore strategies for greener practices, and develop financial mechanisms for better management. His research group collaborates with CSIRO to develop hydrological modelling, with the National Carbon Inventory team to quantify carbon emissions from freshwater systems, and with the Clean Energy Regulator to develop new methodologies to award carbon credits for farm dam management.

This year Dr Malerba was awarded a DECRA Fellowship by the Australian Research Council to expand his research on farm dam emissions.

This webinar is made possible with funding through the Australian Government’s Future Drought Fund Natural Resource Management Drought Resilience Program which is supporting ACT NRM to work with land managers to improve the drought resilience of water resources on rural lands across the ACT.",2022-09-05T00:54:11Z,UCx9IShSOgo1nW36LZg6gu8g,ACT NRM ,[],397,7,0,PT59M28S,22,none,234,45,42713

Up next, The overpopulation myth, debunked by a data scientist ► https://youtu.be/xrbyI-Cuze4

Doomerism about the state of the planet is widespread right now. Many see climate change as an insurmountable problem that we won’t be able to tackle. But the reality tells a different story, says data scientist Hannah Ritchie. 

By stepping back to look at the data and at how the world has changed over centuries, you can actually find examples of really big environmental problems that we've already solved.

By tracing the evolution of human history, we can see that human progress was often very much in conflict with environmental impact. The more that humans progressed, the more the environment degraded. Ritchie argues that now, we're in a unique position where these two things are no longer in conflict, thanks to recent technologies that decouple our human wellbeing with our environmental impact.

In this documentary I present a fictional, optimistic account of the 21st century, told retrospectively from the year 2100. This isn’t trying to depict the “best case scenario”, but one of the possible, mostly positive versions of the century we are all about to live through. A century in which we “won” and overcame climate change. Hopefully it gives you an idea of what is to come, and what the key building blocks to getting to net zero emissions will likely be. And so: what we need to do.

What will climate change look like in the 21st century? How can we beat climate change? How do we get to net zero? How warm will the world be in 2100? This video attempts to answer these questions, or at least provide *an* answer. This video essay in the style of BobbyBroccoli and Jon Bois looks back at the century from the perspective of 2100 and how we got to a stable, warmer world. This educational video talks about the climate crisis, geopolitics, energy, economics, healthcare, and much more besides, all in the context of climate change. 

Important note: this video uses a slightly different temperature timeseries than previous videos in this series. The previous timeseries was of land-based temperature changes, while to fit more in line with the climate literature, this video uses land and sea temperature anomalies. They come from two sources. Data from 1750-1850 is from the PAGES2k Consortium reconstruction (https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/pages2k/neukom2019temp/recons/Full_ensemble_median_and_95pct_range.txt) (median of ensemble) while data from 1850 to 2022 is from NOAAGlobalTemp dataset (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/global-temperature-anomalies/anomalies).

This is creating pollution in the area. Since the 1990s, the temperature is rising 
every decade by 1.5 degrees Celsius here.

xWLCiXyptdM,"""We children, need you to urgently act on the climate crisis""- Teen climate advocate","Alexandria Villaseñor, 14 years old climate advocate, makes an opening speech at the first meeting of UNICEF's Second Executive Board Regular Session. 

Alexandria starts by refering to the call scientists made to act before the irriversible, catastrophic effects of climate change. ""I want to tell you how frustrating it is to know that when I am an adult it will be too late"". 

""My message to you today is a message of urgency. We children, need you to urgently act on the climate crisis""

She also highlights that children are the most affected by climate change, more than adults and tells her personal story of how she was affected by last year's California wild fires. Since then, inspired by Greta Thunberg she has striking outside the UNHQs every friday.  In march 15th, she helped to organize the first Global Climate Strike which mobilized 1.6 million students in over 150 countries. 

""We children, won't stop until our futures are not longer at risk from the climate crisis"". 

She also mentions how children's rights are being violated as all children of the world should have the right to a stable climate system that supports their development and life.

The thicker layer of greenhouse gases traps more heat.
This result in an increase in average temperature of the earth and the earth becomes hotter and hotter.

Plant more trees. Reduce, reuse and recycle. Use less hot water. Turn off electronic devices when not in use. Spread awareness.

The PBS program “Frontline (https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/alaska-vanishing-native-villages/) ” examines the financial, cultural, and human toll of climate change on the western Alaska coastline and the Native people that have always called it home. Hopi producer Patty Talahongva (https://pattytalahongva.com/)  takes a fresh look at the warming temperatures, increasingly destructive storms, and retreating wildlife that are forcing a drastic change in how some Alaska Native live. We’ll hear about the issue from those involved in the documentary.

VFkQSGyeCWg,Greta Thunberg full speech at UN Climate Change COP24 Conference,"15 year old activist Greta Thunberg speaks truth to power at the UN COP24 climate talks:

""My name is Greta Thunberg. I am 15 years old. I am from Sweden.

I speak on behalf of Climate Justice Now.

Many people say that Sweden is just a small country and it doesn't matter what we do.

But I've learned you are never too small to make a difference.

And if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do together if we really wanted to. But to do that, we have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be.

You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake.

You are not mature enough to tell it like is. Even that burden you leave to us children. But I don't care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet.

Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money.

Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few.

The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act.

You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.

Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis.

We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself.

We have not come here to beg world leaders to care. You have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again.

We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time.

We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.

Thank you.""

CSH63qgpGoY,Nature-based solutions in the fight against climate change | Thomas Crowther | TEDxLausanne,"Natural ecosystems are the best technology we have to help cool the planet, but doing so effectively requires an intricate knowledge of the organisms that regulate our climate.

By generating a holistic understanding of Earth’s ecosystems, we transform our ability to understand climate change, and identify the best strategies to address it. 

With this in mind, Crowther and his team of 25 researchers are looking at ways to digitally explore the biosphere and reveal the true potential of nature-based solutions in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss.

Advances in data collection and artificial intelligence are revealing more truths about our environment and the seriousness of climate change. At the same time, it’s also helping to find new solutions that harness the power of nature itself. 

The Crowther Lab research is helping organizations understand the true value of nature, make more informed decisions, and start implementing nature-based solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss.

Get ready to discover a new approach to Climate Change. Thomas Crowther, professor of Global Ecosystem Ecology at ETH Zurich and founder of the Crowther Lab is different to most environmental scientists.

While most labs in the world focus on one field of research, Crowther firmly believes that to understand the ecological processes that influence climate change, predict its progression with high accuracy, and develop nature-based solutions to address it, we need to take a holistic approach.

Specialising in ecosystem ecology, Crowther is also the chief scientific advisor to the UN’s Trillion Tree Campaign. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

What's REALLY Holding Back Climate Action?

Explores What's REALLY Holding Back Climate Action by delving into political inertia, powerful economic interests, and widespread misinformation. It emphasizes how fossil fuels and corporations profit at the expense of urgent reforms, while referencing IPCC warnings and the need for immediate accountability. Ultimately, it calls for grassroots organizing and collective pressure to protect marginalized communities and drive real climate action.

Let’s talk about Earth, how far it has come and where it is going. So far, Earth is the only planet known to mankind that supports life. Our planet has nurtured the human race for millions of years. But now, the planet has reached a point of no return because of climate change and global warming. In this report, we try to understand some of the issues that have gravely affected our planet and with this attempt, we are barely scratching the surface. We also try to understand how much time we have until the planet becomes uninhabitable. Does this planet have an expiry date.

oYhCQv5tNsQ,The Great Global Warming Swindle - Full Documentary HD,"The Great Global Warming Swindle caused controversy in the UK when it premiered March 8, 2007 on British Channel 4. A documentary, by British television producer Martin Durkin, which argues against the virtually unchallenged consensus that global warming is man-made. A statement from the makers of this film asserts that the scientific theory of anthropogenic global warming could very well be ""the biggest scam of modern times."" According to Martin Durkin the chief cause of climate change is not human activity but changes in radiation from the sun. Some have called The Great Global Warming Swindle the definitive retort to Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. Using a comprehensive range of evidence it's claimed that warming over the past 300 years represents a natural recovery from a 'little ice age'.
According to the program humans do have an effect on climate but it's infinitesimally small compared with the vast natural forces which are constantly pushing global temperatures this way and that. From melting glaciers and rising sea levels, The Great Global Warming Swindle debunks the myths, and exposes what may well prove to be the darkest chapter in the history of mankind. According to a group of leading scientists brought together by documentary maker Martin Durkin everything you've ever been told about global warming is probably untrue. Just as we've begun to take it for granted that climate change is a man-made phenomenon, Durkin's documentary slays the whole premise of global warming.
""Global warming has become a story of huge political significance; environmental activists using scare tactics to further their cause; scientists adding credence to secure billions of dollars in research money; politicians after headlines and a media happy to play along. No-one dares speak against it for risk of being unpopular, losing funds and jeopardizing careers.""

The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.

RCP 8.5 has often been referred to as “business as usual.” It describes a world without action on climate policy and continued fossil fuel use expanding unchecked, leading to a truly apocalyptic future for our climate and everything living on our planet – including us. 

For this episode we wanted to see where we are in terms of “business as usual,” and if we are still headed towards an apocalypse of sorts… or if, perhaps, all of the technological innovations in renewables and EVs along with new climate policy such as the Paris Agreement might have bent down the curve on global warming. So tune into this episode of Weathered to see where we’ve been in our race against the clock, where we’re going, and how the RCP scenarios can help us understand this story as well as our future on this planet. 

Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.

A new greenhouse gas inventory has revealed that what people eat makes up a third of the city's source of emissions. That has prompted officials to push for plant-based diets, which they say are good for both consumers and the environment. According to some estimates, food makes up nearly 20% of all of New York's waste, with nearly four million tonnes ending up in landfills each year.

JkxcBYTWFxY,Climate Change: Impacts of Global Warming and Deforestation 🌍 | Newsround,"#Newsround #livingplanetreport #climatechange #environment #rainforest 

Welcome to the official BBC Newsround YouTube channel. Subscribe here ➡️.➡️ ➡️  https://bit.ly/3bYidJ3

Climate change is forcing many species of monkeys and lemurs that normally live high in trees spend more time on the ground, a new study has found.

Experts say that global warming and deforestation are driving the primates to the forest floor more frequently so they can search for food, water and shelter.

Spending more time on the ground may help to protect some species from some of the effects of warming temperatures.

However, scientists have warned that not all species are able to adapt to this change, leaving some potentially more in danger than others.

In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an international team of scientists looked at more than 150,000 hours of data on several different lemur and monkey species at various sites in the Americas and Madagascar.

They found that among many tree-living primates, the hotter the environment, the longer they spent on the ground.

The same was true in areas which were more deforested - fewer trees made it warmer so the animals largely adapted by moving down from the trees.

Researchers also looked at others factors too, such as whether humans might have an impact on this behaviour.

If the monkeys lived near to roads or where humans lived - in places where they were more likely to come into contact with humans - then the opposite was true and the monkeys spent more time in trees and were less likely to come down to the forest floor.

Experts added that this could suggest that the presence of humans could get in the way of these species being able to adapt to climate change.

Scientists said that for these species, conservation plans would be needed to help ensure their survival.

A lot of people consider climate change the most important crisis that the world is facing today.

But what is it? And why are so many scientists, campaigners and politicians concerned about its effects?

It is a complicated issue - but a very important one.

What is climate change?
When we talk about climate change, we are talking about global changes in the Earth's average temperature.

The Earth's average temperature moves up and down naturally, but it has been increasing more rapidly than it usually does.

This change is impacting on the planet's environment - which is everything natural around us; rivers, trees, plants, animals... everything!

Scientists say many of the changes to the Earth's climate are caused by human activity - this means things that humans are doing.

Some of those things are:

Burning of oil, coal and gas - These resources are called fossil fuels - they are used to power factories, buildings and transportation. When burnt they release substances into the atmosphere, including a gas called carbon dioxide, which trap heat from the sun and warm up the Earth. This is called the greenhouse effect.
Waste - The way waste is disposed of often adds to these harmful emissions. Even food waste creates another greenhouse gas called methane when it rots.
Deforestation and urbanization - Urbanisation is when more people start living in cities, and deforestation is when a forest or tree-covered area is turned into something else (for example a farm or space for houses). Trees help us by absorbing carbon dioxide - but they release it back into the air again when they are cut down.
Population growth - This means the growing number of people in the world. Did you know in 1960 there were only 3 billion people in the world, whereas there are currently more than 7 billion people who all need food to eat and places to live!

Breaking Down Our Carbon Emissions | Climate Now Ep. 1.2,"Emissions of greenhouse gases are rising dramatically worldwide, but it can be challenging to grasp just how much we are emitting, and where those emissions come from. Here we break down how much we are emitting in total, by country and region, and by economic sector. We also discuss the relationship between key economic and demographic variables and greenhouse gas emissions.

Transcript:
Human greenhouse gas emissions have already caused 1 degree Celsius or 2 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming. And we’re on track to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius or 3 degrees Fahrenheit by 2030. In order to curb our greenhouse gas emissions, we have to understand three things: What are we emitting? And how much of it? What are the sources of those emissions? What are the underlying drivers of emissions?

So, number one, what are we emitting and how much? Greenhouse gas emissions include many different gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and others. But CO2 makes up by far the largest share of the total. In 2019, CO2 emissions reached 38 gigatons CO2, a staggering weight. And that’s just CO2. If we count all greenhouse gases, 2019 total emissions reached 52.4 gigatons of CO2 warming equivalent, which is abbreviated GtCO2e.

Emissions reached record highs in 2019, but it’s important to understand that the warming effects from greenhouse gases do not depend on how much we release in any given year or even how much we’ve released over the last five years, because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds, if not over a thousand years. So we’re living with the cumulative effects of the greenhouse gases we have released since the industrial revolution. And that total is a staggering 1.5 trillion tons of CO2. And despite the urgent need for rapid decarbonization, the amount of greenhouse gases that we release each year is only growing and growing very, very quickly.

We can look at this skyrocketing number through a couple of different lenses. Number one, by country. It’s clear that the vast majority of emissions come from just a few countries. The top four emitters, United States of America, EU plus the UK, China and India, have contributed about 55% of total emissions over the last decade. If you expand that group to the G 20 members, you get to about 78%.

But the largest recent emitters are not the same as the countries that have admitted the most in total. The US and the EU have contributed just under 50%, or 25% and 22%, respectively, of cumulative global emissions. China has contributed 12.7%, and India falls to sixth place on this list behind the US, the EU, China, Russia, and Japan.

We can also rank total emissions by economic sector to understand which activities are driving the problem. Doing so makes clear that there will never be a single solution to decarbonizing the economy because the use of fossil fuels and sources of emissions within each sector are so diverse.

He explains how the financial interests of fossil fuel companies have blocked the policymaking process in key countries -- and calls for a global epiphany to take on the climate crisis.

yeaQUhAOdtk,How to fight climate change with parking lots,"Why haven’t we covered them in solar panels?

In 2021, President Biden set an ambitious climate goal for the US to reach net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. And as part of the transition to renewable energy, the country has drastically ramped up production of solar over the past few years. But that’s led to a new problem: finding enough land on which to put solar panels. 

The easiest and cheapest places to install solar panels are often large, undeveloped plots of land. It's why, in many places across the country, we've seen rural areas — including fragile desert ecosystems and valuable farmland — turned into solar farms. Many local residents and conservationists have protested these rural solar projects for a variety of reasons: Some want to keep natural views, others want to retain space for agriculture or aim to preserve biodiversity. Solar will likely play an important role in the country’s move away from fossil fuels — but is there a smarter way to do it that doesn’t require taking up so much rural land?

In the video above, we explore one option that could help: parking lots. Solar photovoltaics researcher and professor Joshua Pearce goes into the data on how placing solar canopies over parking lots could be a worthwhile investment for many cities. And as more countries, like France, are moving toward retrofitting parking spaces with solar, we look at what it could mean in the US.

fT0JxK3FK3A,#COP26 What Did it All Mean? - Highlights and Conclusions | Climate Action | United Nations,"After two weeks of tough negotiations, the 26th UN Climate Conference has come to an end. Member States reached an agreement that the United Nations Secretary-General called an important step in addressing climate change, but not enough.

In this conversation wrap-up, learn about the facts and highlights of the Conference, watch an interview with Martina Donlon, who leads climate communications at the UN, and join Producers Laura Quiñones and Conor Lennon as they look back on the action of the last two weeks.
------------------
After extending the COP26 climate negotiations an extra day, nearly 200 countries meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, adopted on Saturday an outcome document that, according to the UN Secretary-General, “reflects the interests, the contradictions, and the state of political will in the world today”.

“It is an important step but is not enough. We must accelerate climate action to keep alive the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees”, said António Guterres in a video statement released at the close of the two-week meeting.

The UN chief added that it is time to go “into emergency mode”, ending fossil fuel subsidies, phasing out coal, putting a price on carbon, protecting vulnerable communities, and delivering the $100 billion climate finance commitment.

“We did not achieve these goals at this conference. But we have some building blocks for progress,” he said.

Mr. Guterres also had a message to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, and all those leading the charge on climate action.

“I know you are disappointed. But the path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches. But I know we can get there. We are in the fight of our lives, and this fight must be won. Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward”.

kM9nQ5DNVwA,How Does Food Waste Affect Agricultural Carbon Emissions? - Earth Science Answers,"How Does Food Waste Affect Agricultural Carbon Emissions? In this informative video, we will uncover the impact of food waste on agricultural carbon emissions and its relation to climate change. We will discuss how the process of food production contributes to carbon emissions through various means, including the use of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases from fertilizers and livestock farming. You will learn about the significant emissions associated with food that is ultimately wasted and what happens to that waste once it is discarded. 

We will explore the implications of food waste on land use and how it affects potential carbon absorption by natural ecosystems. By understanding these connections, we can see how reducing food waste can lead to lower agricultural carbon emissions and promote a more efficient food system. 

Join us as we discuss practical steps for preventing food waste, including better planning and storage techniques. We will also touch on alternative waste management methods and their effectiveness in addressing the emissions from wasted food. This video is a must-watch for anyone interested in environmental issues and sustainable practices. Don’t forget to subscribe to our channel for more engaging discussions on earth science and sustainability.

It will also require approaches that tackle the political economy of the low-carbon transition and help communities build long-lasting resilience to climate change. What are the investments needed to achieve a green, resilient and sustainable future? How can we unlock private finance for climate action? How are countries stepping up to the challenge? This event will look at the actions that are needed to create enabling environments, leverage different pools of capital at the right time, for specific needs, while involving communities and bringing them along in the global low-carbon, resilient transition.

SCIENCE 9 | Quarter 3
Module 2
Lesson Topic: What is Climate Change?
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), made up of the world’s leading climate scientists, set out the final part of its mammoth sixth assessment report on Monday. 

The comprehensive review of human knowledge of the climate crisis took hundreds of scientists eight years to compile and runs to thousands of pages, but boiled down to one message: act now, or it will be too late.

G1YoKznWYjE,The Global Climate Wall: Wealthy Nations Prioritize Militarizing Borders Over Climate Action,"The world’s richest countries have responded by militarizing their borders and treating the humanitarian crisis as a security issue. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attended this year’s U.N. climate summit, marking the first time a top alliance leader came to the climate talks since they began. On Tuesday, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at COP26 raised the issue of security during a press conference. “The richest countries are building a climate wall against the consequences of climate change rather than dealing with the causes and rather than providing the money that would enable people to stay,” says Nick Buxton, with the Transnational Institute and co-author of their new report, “Global Climate Wall: How the world’s wealthiest nations prioritise borders over climate action.” We also speak with Santra Denis, executive director of the Miami Workers Center, about the focus of the It Takes Roots grassroots delegation at COP26. She says that in order to protect frontline communities and workers, the U.S. should focus on investing in low-carbon and adaptation industries instead of border control.

Nisreen Elsaim (Sudan) is a climate activist and junior negotiator at intergovernmental climate change platforms with experience across a range of environmental topics, and she was part of the social movement that brought about democratic change in Sudan.

The Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change
Building on the youth climate movement, the Secretary-General launched his Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change on 27 July to amplify youth voices and to engage young people in an open and transparent dialogue as the UN gears up to raise ambition and accelerate action to tackle the climate emergency.

Its members will bring the voices of young people into high-level decision making and advise the Secretary-General on the implementation of his 2020-21 Climate Change Strategy.

--------
The next decade is critical to increase ambition to keep 1.5°C in reach and adapt to the impact of climate change. Across mitigation, adaptation and finance, COP26 must be a turning point. Global leaders will come together to show that ambition and discuss what must be done to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The leaders will hear the latest scientific reporting and examine the state of progress, hearing success stories, but also what is at stake for countries across the world if we do not take action, together, now.

---

The United Kingdom will host the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow on 31 October – 12 November 2021. The COP26 summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

World leaders are expected to put forward high level ambition and action towards securing global net zero and keeping 1.5 degrees in reach; adapting to protect communities and natural habitats; and mobilising finance.

To limit the impact, the Government of Canada aims to reduce GHG emissions 40–45% by 2030, compared to levels in 2005. And heat pumps are emerging as a solution, increasing energy efficiency while cutting energy costs and lowering carbon emissions. Shawn Carr, Manager of Customer Experience at Hydro Ottawa, explains on thinkenergy episode 109.

ZEyziGHThZc,Suvo Strategic Minerals’ Colliecrete to play crucial role in reducing carbon emissions,"Suvo Strategic Minerals Ltd (ASX:SUV) non-executive chairman Aaron Banks joins Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss the latest developments with Colliecrete. Banks outlines Suvo’s collaboration with Dowsing Group on the Bunbury Outer Ring Road Project in Western Australia and talks about how Colliecrete can play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions by 50-70%, showcasing its potential to change future construction practices.
Banks also sheds light on the ideal markets for Suvo’s geopolymer concrete, and the strategic additions of Peter Snowsill and Martin Anda to the team, enhancing Suvo’s expertise and vision.
“We welcome Peter to the team to help progress the MoUs with Dowsing Group and PERMAcast as well as prioritise the almost daily inquiries we’re now receiving on our low carbon geopolymer concrete,” Banks said in Suvo’s recent announcement.
“Securing a strategically located site to commence trial pours of Colliecrete in preparation for the BORR demonstration pour, is another step forward and we thank Peel for offering their land and services. We look forward to updating the market once we have commenced trial pours of our low-carbon concrete.”
Finally, Banks looks at what investors can expect from the company in the next 90 days.

XUxizKqwXMw,New warning over climate change from Siberian Arctic  - BBC News,"Stark new findings of an international team of scientists led by the UK Met Office has raise profound questions about the future of the earth's climate.

The team says that a prolonged heatwave in the Siberian Arctic this year is “unequivocal evidence of climate change’”.  The scientists say the record  rise in temperatures there would be impossible without man-made global warming.

The findings are of serious concern because here in the UK and the rest of Europe, the Arctic drives much of the weather systems we experience.

7kV4zvPlXFA,Corruption and the Climate Crisis | Transparency International,"*(English, French and Spanish subtitles available)*

The climate crisis is arguably the biggest global challenge we have ever faced. The cost of responding to it, adapting to and mitigating the worst effects of global heating will be immense. These huge financial investments create tempting opportunities for corruption.

The climate crisis affects all of us and corruption weakens our ability to respond to its impacts. If we are going to do something about it, we must start with ensuring that our city, state, and national governments meet their climate goals.

For the last seven years, Transparency International's Climate Governance Integrity Programme has been working to safeguard climate finance and take action against abuse, mismanagement, and waste by demanding maximum transparency, accountability and integrity from the global to the local level.

dbFuqCPzJwg,Renault EMBLEME | Con l'IDROGENO e tante INNOVAZIONI per ridurre l'impronta di carbonio emessa,"In un periodo di profonda trasformazione per il settore automotive, Renault ha svelato la sua rivoluzionaria demo-car, Renault Emblème, che abbiamo visto da vicino. Questo prototipo incarna la visione di Renault verso un futuro più elettrificato e sostenibile, traducendosi in un impegno concreto per ridurre le emissioni di anidride carbonica fino al 90% rispetto alla sua attuale gamma di veicoli.

Con la Emblème, Renault adotta un approccio innovativo che abbraccia l'intero ciclo di vita del veicolo, con un chiaro obiettivo: abbattere del 90% le emissioni di gas serra. Questo impegno si traduce in una produzione e un funzionamento intrinsecamente sostenibili, grazie all'impiego di materiali riciclati e rinnovabili e a tecnologie produttive ecologiche. La visione di Renault è un futuro a zero emissioni di carbonio, un traguardo che si prefigge di raggiungere in Europa entro il 2040 e nel resto del mondo entro il 2050.

Con i suoi 4,80 metri di lunghezza e un passo di 2,90 metri, la Renault Emblème si presenta con un design da shooting brake che bilancia sapientemente dinamismo e praticità, ideale per le esigenze delle famiglie. L'estetica è resa distintiva dalla carrozzeria in tinta verde dicroica, una scelta cromatica che gioca con la luce e l'angolo di visuale, offrendo riflessi sempre nuovi.

La Renault Emblème si distingue per soluzioni tecnologiche innovative, tra cui l'eliminazione dei retrovisori a favore di telecamere integrate e una sofisticata gestione aerodinamica che minimizza la resistenza dell'aria, attestandosi su un Cx di 0,25. Questa sinergia tra tecnologia e design non solo incrementa l'efficienza, ma segna anche un'evoluzione significativa nello stile distintivo di Renault.

Renault Emblème offre una motorizzazione intelligente bi-energy: una batteria elettrica da 40 kWh per i tuoi tragitti quotidiani e una cella a combustibile a idrogeno per le avventure più lunghe. Questa soluzione assicura un baricentro basso per una guida più agile e un'autonomia totale che può raggiungere i 1.000 km, con il vantaggio di un rapido ""pieno"" di idrogeno.

2p0rORbTIlk,Ice hockey in the Himalayas - Playing in the climate crisis | DW Documentary,"Deachen from Ladakh has a dream - to qualify for the youth squad of India’s national women’s ice hockey team. But because of the climate crisis, winters are getting shorter meaning there’s less time to train.

The 15-year-old Indian girl Deachen rubs her hands before pulling on large ice hockey gloves and picking up her hockey stick. She then squints up at the snow-capped Himalayan peaks. She should really be training on proper ice by now. But instead, she’s forced to practice with a tennis ball on tarmac. That is because the lakes on the high plateaus of Ladakh are not yet frozen over. This region is also feeling the effects of global warming: bodies of water are turning to ice later and winters are shorter. Because there are no ice rinks, this means there is less time to train. Ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Ladakh, in the north of India.

India’s national women’s ice hockey team was founded in 2017. It is Deachen’s big dream to join it one day, to play professionally and travel the world. Luckily, it’ll soon be vacation time and she can leave her boarding school in the capital Leh and go home, to the mountain village of Chumathang. Once there, she will be able to get back on the ice and seize a major opportunity: the captain of the Indian national women’s team is coming to her village to scout for new talent for the youth squad. Will Deachen manage to qualify?

7ALeNj7cp_s,Our Water Crisis Is WAY WORSE than You Think...Here's Why,"From California’s epic few years of droughts and floods to wells running dry and aquifers depleting, water is a critical environmental issue. So, what do we do about it? In this episode, Maiya May tries to figure this out. To start, she visits Tulare Lake, California, once a critical water reserve and cultural site for the Tachi-Yokut tribe, which has re-emerged after 150 years. Maiya learns about agriculture's challenges, the depletion of groundwater, and finds hope in innovative farming practices that reduce emissions and conserve water. She then heads back to California to learn how water officials are utilizing floods to recharge critical aquifers.

qfUCZ5XdMPo,"World on the verge of climate crisis ‘abyss’, warns UN","In a new report, the United Nations has issued another stark warning over the state of the global climate.
“We are on the verge of the abyss,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a press conference as he unveiled the State of the Global Climate 2020 report by the WMO on Monday.
The report described 2020 as one of the hottest years on record, about 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, with global temperatures moving dangerously close to the 1.5-degree cap set by the Paris agreement.
That is despite the economic slowdown, and lower greenhouse gas emissions, over the last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Lantas bagaimana bumi kita bisa semakin panas?

6ZrnVobXWFQ,Community Climate Action: Upcycling and mending at the Repair Café | Friends of the Earth,"If we're going to build a greener and healthier future, we have to tackle our waste problem. 

For too long we've been part of a linear economy, where products are made to break and destined to end up in landfill. We need to make a shift to a zero-waste, circular economy, where items are made to last and can be repaired or made into new items. This creates less strain on our planet, saves money and resources, and would create jobs. 

The good news is communities around the country (and across the world) are stepping up to the challenge by opening repair cafés; upcycling and repair hubs where locals can get everyday items fixed for free. 

Come inside a repair café with us and hear from the founders about the benefits to their community and the planet, and get inspired to explore a repair café yourself!

KHxAqG1thdY,"Water Crisis in Pakistan: A Wake-Up Call I Scarcity, Climate Change & Policy Failure","PIDE hosted an insightful seminar on Water Security in Pakistan, featuring Basharat Ahmed Saeed, Senior Water Specialist at The World Bank Group, Pakistan. In this talk, Mr. Saeed discusses the critical issues surrounding water management, sustainability, and policy challenges that Pakistan faces in the wake of climate change and growing water scarcity.

Key Topics Covered:
The current state of water resources in Pakistan
Challenges in water distribution and access
Policy frameworks and institutional roles
Strategies for sustainable water management
The role of international organizations in water security 

#WaterSecurity #Pakistan #PIDE #WorldBank #ClimateChange #Sustainability #Development #WaterManagement #Seminar

Water scarcity is a frightening situation that is already happening in #Pakistan. The country ranks 14 among the 17 ‘extremely high #water risk’ countries of the world, a list that includes hot and dry countries like Saudi Arabia. Over 80 percent of the total #population in the country faces ‘severe water scarcity’ for at least one month of the year. In addition to surface water, Pakistan’s groundwater resources—the last resort of water supply—are severely overdrawn, mainly to supply water for irrigation. If the situation remains unchanged, the whole country may face ‘water #scarcity’ by 2025. The situation is strategically more complicated, as #Pakistan is the lower riparian country to #India and 78 percent of its water inflows from therein. Moreover, only two-thirds of available water is being utilized while one-third of the water is either lost or discharged into the sea.

Cities in Pakistan are increasingly faced with problems of erratic supply of piped water and unsafe and declining levels of #groundwater. Additionally, over one-third (35 to 40 percent) of piped water is wasted through leakages and theft in the water distribution networks. By 2050, the country’s #urban population is expected to double in size (from 81 million in 2022 to 160 million in 2050 or from 37.7 percent of the total population to 52.2 percent) (see table 1). Providing water for these citizens is a challenging task; finding #money to pay for the provision of that water is at least as daunting. Urban water tariffs are low and infrequently adjusted, even with current efforts at #reform.

HVLtNCaK_9Y,Carbon Capture and Sequestration: Reducing Carbon Emissions On and Off the Road,"Our innovative bioprocessing facilities are identifying ways to reduce emissions beyond biofuels’ role in decarbonizing cars on the road today.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage are ways to harness  and sequester emissions from bioprocessing facilities instead of releasing them into the air.

The carbon captured at bioprocessing facilities is 99.9% pure and biogenic due to the fermentation process of bioethanol. Sourced from plants instead of fossil fuels and containing no other pollutants, this carbon is essential to many supply chains.

The captured carbon is used for everything from treating municipal water and carbonating beverages to creating fabrics and bioplastics, providing the dry ice needed to store vaccines, and helping to keep food fresh.

Plants are also developing cutting edge technologies to permanently and safely store the carbon underground in deep geological reservoirs, a technique that scientists agree is critical to achieving global and U.S. climate goals.

On average, participating plants each capture 100 – 150 thousand tons of carbon a year, the equivalent of removing 20,000 vehicles off the road every year per participating plant.

Carbon capture and sequestration have an impact on future innovations as well, by reducing bioethanol’s lifecycle carbon intensity score and bringing the industry closer to net-zero emissions.

It’s also vital for creating and protecting clean energy jobs across rural America.

This innovation taking place today at bioprocessing facilities supports our nation’s goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Massive flooding, huge forest fires, droughts and thunderstorms are all becoming more frequent and powerful and putting a strain on our way of life!

What would it look like if a familiar environment was flooded, dried out or set on fire?

Global warming will effect everyone, so its important to know what some of the outcomes could look like so we can plan more effectively.

Increases in temperature will both increase the amount of droughts that will hit countries and melt the ice caps giving rise to the sea levels and permanently flooding low level coastal villages and towns.

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.

Questions for Schools:
- What is climate change?
- Why do we have climate change?
- What effect does climate change have on the planet?
- How can we help to stop climate change?

Script: 

The world faces a serious crisis, one that will ruin whole economies and lead to needless suffering and death. 

The crisis is related to climate change, but not in the way you’re probably thinking.  

It’s the global energy crisis—a man-made crisis created by climate change policies.

These policies have led to a shortage of fossil fuels—oil, coal, and natural gas, the fuels that provide over 80% of the world’s energy. 

A shortage of anything leads to higher prices. That’s just basic economics. 

Fossil fuel shortages have led to higher energy prices. And because the energy industry powers every other industry, this has led to higher prices of almost everything, everywhere.

We are already seeing the consequences.

Inflation

Inflation spares no one, but those who live paycheck-to-paycheck suffer the most. Every purchase becomes a major decision. Inflation in the US in 2022 was around eight percent, in the UK, ten percent, and in many developing countries, much higher. The leading driver of this inflation has been the cost of energy.

Deadly Winters

Contrary to popular belief, far more people die from cold than heat. Saving lives from the danger of cold requires low-cost, reliable energy. Without it, people on the margins can’t adequately heat their homes during the harsh winter months. Even in wealthy Europe, literally thousands will die for lack of energy.

Widespread job losses

When energy prices increase dramatically, industries scale back or shut down altogether.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, “Europe’s energy crisis has left few businesses untouched… Some industries, such as the energy-intensive metals sector, are shutting factories that analysts and executives say might never reopen, imperiling thousands of jobs.”

Mass starvation

Modern agriculture depends on fossil fuels: natural gas is a prime component of fertilizer and farming equipment is largely powered by diesel fuel. When natural gas and oil prices go up, food becomes more expensive around the world. 

According to the President of the World Farmers’ Organization: “Prices are…78 percent higher than… in 2021…In many regions [in the developing world] farmers simply can’t afford… fertilizers… or even if they could, the fertilizers are not available to them.”           

Not enough fertilizer means not enough food.

While the whole world suffers from an energy crisis, the worst affected are poor nations that are getting outbid for scarce energy supplies. Bangladesh has recently experienced widespread power outages. They simply can’t get the energy they need. A desperate Europe is grabbing all it can, leaving this east Asian nation literally in the dark.

This will lead to… 

Civil unrest.

We saw this in Sri Lanka in 2022. Violent riots wracked the country following massive crop failures. A leading reason for the crop failures: a lack of fertilizer due to anti-natural gas, anti-fertilizer policies.

The root cause of all these problems and the very real suffering that results is the same.

Not enough fossil fuel.

But there is no need for shortages of fossil fuel.

We have all the fossil fuels we need and then some. We are literally standing on it. 

We just can’t get to it. 

We can’t get to it because governments have decided we shouldn’t use fossil fuels.

They say we’re in a climate crisis. 

But while climate change—humans impacting climate—is a real thing, “climate crisis” is not.

The world is slowly becoming warmer—at a cold point in geological history when many more people die of cold than of heat. This doesn’t at all justify rapidly restricting global fossil fuel use.

Fossil fuels actually make us far safer from the climate by providing low-cost energy for the amazing machines that protect us against storms, protect us against extreme temperatures, and alleviate drought. Climate disaster deaths have decreased 98% over the last century.

The Montreal Protocol was an international agreement designed to stop the destruction of the ozone layer, and it worked. So why did this one succeed when so many other climate agreements failed? Today we take a look at the ozone situation, the science of why it's an issue, and how the Montreal Protocol is working to reverse the damage.

8ONGuJCIkpQ,The Climate Change Conspiracy... Conspiracy | Anjali Appadurai | TEDxSurreySalon,"Anjali Appadurai recounts a profound realization during a focus group with a young mother, highlighting her guilt over her contribution to climate change despite limited choices. The talk delves into the historical deception by petroleum companies regarding climate science and introduces the concept of ""the new climate denial,"" acknowledging climate change but advocating for more fossil fuels. The speaker urges viewers to challenge this denial by envisioning bold climate solutions that benefit society as a whole. By rejecting incremental solutions and embracing transformative action, the talk inspires hope for a sustainable future, emphasizing the need for collective action to combat the climate crisis and create a better world for future generations. Anjali Appadurai is a climate justice organizer and campaigner. As a young activist, she worked with youth movements from around the world to build a strong civil society voice at the UN Climate Convention and to ensure that social movements' demands were heard in the halls of power. She runs the Padma Centre for Climate Justice, a project that brings together diasporic communities to build power around issues of climate and economic justice, and she works as Campaigns Director at the Climate Emergency Unit. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

2XXw8GlaF9E,Indigenous Peoples: On the frontline of climate change & biodiversity loss UN Chief | United Nations,"Remarks by António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, at the Opening Ceremony of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 24th session.

---

The world’s Indigenous Peoples are magnificently diverse in cultures, languages, histories, and traditions...

But united by common features and common challenges. 

You are the pre-eminent stewards of the world’s biodiversity and of the environment.

Your knowledge and traditional practices are leading models of conservation and sustainable use – reflecting your commitment to living life in harmony with Mother Earth, and to the wellbeing and rights of future generations.

The world has much to learn from your wisdom, insights and approaches, which prioritise the health of ecosystems over short-term economic gains…

As we tackle the many challenges that we face – building sustainable food systems, moving to sustainable ways of livings, and more, we must recognize that the world does not always value you as it should.

---

The difficulties facing Indigenous Peoples around the world are an affront to dignity and justice. And a source of deep sorrow for me personally.

Indigenous women face particular challenges – including barriers to political participation, economic opportunities, and essential services.

On a trip to Suriname three years ago, I had the honour of visiting the Kaliña Peoples. 

I witnessed how climate change is devastating their lands, and destroying their way of life.

And I heard how mercury from illegal mining is harming Indigenous Peoples in the region, as in many others, namely, including Brazil - poisoning their water and food supplies. 

Everywhere, Indigenous Peoples are on the frontline of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss – despite having done nothing to create these crises and everything to try to stop them.

Eviction and illegal exploitation continue to harm your people and grossly violate your rights.

You face marginalisation, discrimination, unemployment, economic disadvantage and horrendous violence – particularly as you seek to defend our common home.  

And too often you are excluded from decisions that directly impact your land and territories – threatening your ways of life and food security.

Meanwhile, a looming threat grows – the race for minerals critical to the global energy transition – a large proportion of which are located on or close to Indigenous Peoples’ territories.

As demand soars, too often we see dispossession; exclusion and marginalisation in decision-making; the rights of Indigenous Peoples trampled and health jeopardised, all as you are denied the benefits you deserve.

JEKUo1La7VI,"Perspective : CLIMATE CHANGE - NO TIME TO LOSE | 21 March, 2023","The world is very likely to miss the most important climate target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which would cause irrevocable damage to the planet’s ecosystem and severely impact humans and other living beings, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN-backed body of the world’s leading climate scientists has warned.

Releasing the report on Monday, scientists said keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels requires deep, rapid and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors.

Reacting to the report, United Nations Chief Antonio Guterres said: Humanity is on thin ice - and that ice is melting fast... The climate time-bomb is ticking. The 1.5-degree limit is achievable. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action.

Guterres urged rich countries to reach net zero by 2040 and developing countries to aim for 2050.

The IPCC Synthesis Report is a summary of all the reports produced since 2015 on the reasons and consequences of global temperature rise due to anthropogenic emissions.

On this broadcast, we’ll analyse the key takeaways of the IPCC report and try to understand from experts what the world needs to do to ensure rapid, deep and immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions to prevent the overshoot.

The law will require labels on genetically engineered foods sold at retail outlets in the state of Vermont starting in July of 2016. The bill was signed into law on May 8, 2014. Unlike labeling laws passed in Maine and Connecticut, Vermont’s law does not require other states to act first before products will be labeled. 

The day the bill was signed into law, a consortium of corporate interests including the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the International Dairy Foods Association, and the Snack Food Association announced that they would sue the state to stop the law from going into effect. Initial arguments in the case are expected to start in late 2014 or 2015.

I'm tired of both overly optimistic messages from climate activists and scare stories of the impending apocalypse. It's about time we get realistic. ""Net zero” by 2050 is not a realistic goal and it's about time we admit it. I am afraid that many plans that are eating up money are fuelled by wishful thinking rather than by rational thought. Let’s have a look.

Correction to what I say at 01:30, that should have been ""according to current policies and actions"" (not just ""policies"")

Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have been undergoing rapid and extreme changes in recent years, including unprecedented heatwaves and record-low sea ice levels.

Over the past week, more than 450 researchers gathered in Hobart for the inaugural Australian Antarctic Research Conference — the first such event in more than a decade.

Almost two thirds of attendees were early career researchers, who have released a joint statement titled, Making Antarctica Cool Again.

The statement warns of the potential dire consequences of global sea level rise caused by melting ice sheets.

The heat has increased so much that even our glaciers are melting, and it's all happening because of human actions. People are dumping chemicals into rivers, pollution from factories is increasing, which is making the Earth hotter and causing problems like global warming and climate change. People are also cutting down trees, and this is affecting not just the temperature around us but the entire environment. Nature is breaking down, and we are harming our own planet.

But now, it's time for change.

If we all take small steps together—plant trees, reduce pollution, and cut down on plastic use—we can make a big difference. Earth is our home, and saving it is our responsibility. Let's come together to create a future where nature smiles, where everyone breathes clean air, and where our future generations can live on a beautiful and safe planet.

Change begins with us

What are the unanswered questions about climate change? What don't we know about the climate crisis? What do IPCC scientists say we don't know? Where could I do research on climate change? In this video I look at a report written by IPCC scientists about our gaps in understanding of climate change.

afPVy0yiLRw,The climate crisis: Can smart ideas save the planet? | DW Documentary,"Can high-tech solutions help protect the climate? What would be the side effects of further human intervention in nature?

Attempts are being made to reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere with technical solutions. For example, new carbon capture technology that can extract CO2 from air and water, even if the amount currently captured is minimal and not enough to prevent the climate crisis and its consequences. 
Still, there is no shortage of ideas. Adding basalt rock dust to agricultural fields not only binds carbon dioxide but keeps the soil fertile. Biochar, made from organic waste, has a similar effect. 
Some ideas are bolder: A protective screen of particles in the upper layers of the atmosphere could filter sunlight, as seen with the eruption of the Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines in 1991. The millions of tons of sulfur dioxide spewed into the stratosphere cooled the earth significantly. 
Theoretically, aircraft could be used to deliver the particles. But experts warn that the consequences for humans and the weather would be felt worldwide and could never be fully controlled.

The UN Emissions Gap report indicates that if only “current policies” are implemented the world could warm by up to 3.1C.
 
This would be “catastrophic” for the world according to the UN, leading to dramatic increases in extreme weather events including heatwaves and floods.
 
The UN's predictions of temperature rise have stayed essentially the same over the past three years since countries met in Glasgow for the COP26 climate summit.

What comes to mind when you think of business and climate change? No matter what you picture, one thing holds true: While the private sector is largely responsible for the climate crisis, businesses also have a tremendous amount of resources and influence—and therefore, obligation—to take action. It’s time for companies to approach corporate sustainability with a new, holistic perspective that aligns all parts of their business with an equitable climate future.

From deeply and quickly reducing emissions to advocating for critical climate policy, when businesses expand their solutions aperture, they also expand who is needed to implement these solutions—creating a diverse ecosystem of skill sets and ideas all in the service of climate solutions.

Solutions offer hope. That's the belief of Solutionaries, a show from Graham Media Group focusing on the people and ideas taking on some of our biggest challenges. Each episode focuses on effective responses to problems and offers viewers ways to join the positive change. 

Our latest episode on Climate Change, featured stories include: 

Cooling off urban heat

Cities everywhere have established pockets of impervious ground coverage, dense commercial districts, and not enough green spaces. Those areas are known as urban heat islands. They can be dangerous and throw off the balance of nature. That recipe creates heat, and it becomes trapped within the hard surfaces of streets, sidewalks, and buildings.

But solutions do exist! 

Groups are working to beat the heat in many ways, from mapping out city temperatures to rethinking pavement to changing the cityscape. 
 
02:32 Mapping the city heat
13:24 Changing to a cooler pavement
28:31 Depaving their way back to paradise

Solar-powered homes 

Many homeowners have made the switch to solar, but is it all it's cracked up to be? How expensive is it to make the switch? Do I wash my hands of the energy company I've always had if I go solar?  

So many questions, but fear not–we have answers!

20:16 Is it time to make the switch to solar? 

Protecting the Coral Reefs

Get this: 95% of Florida's coastal coral reefs have been attacked by a deadly disease! But volunteers and some major league muscle is tackling the problem. Names like Disney and SeaWorld have stepped up significantly alongside average diving enthusiasts to save the reefs.

And there's another group helping marine life in an unorthodox fashion. You'll see how burying a loved one at sea can help ocean life thrive.  

37:27 Disney World, volunteers, and politicians are fighting for Florida's coral reefs
48:09 Eternal reefs: a way to memorialize loved ones and foster marine growth at the same time

Churchill, a town in Manitoba, Canada, is known as the polar bear capital of the world, and is noticing the effects of climate change on the number of bears spotted.
 
Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of the town - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.
 
The BBC’s Victoria Gill has been in Churchill along with a team of polar bear researchers.

m7d1hCf_q2U,Melting wetlands - How can nature slow down climate change? | DW Documentary,"Bogs and swamps contain more carbon than all other ground vegetation. As the permafrost melts, greenhouse gases are released, which in turn accelerate global warming.

Peatlands and wetlands play an important role in global warming because they influence the greenhouse gas cycle. But not all bogs are the same. Some bind carbon, while others release it into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. 

The film follows the work of two research teams investigating the influence of moors and swamps on the climate. Greenhouse gases escape when permafrost moors melt. But swamp and mire areas that have been thrown out of balance, for example by plantation farming for the production of palm oil, can actually accelerate climate change. 

The documentary explains what happens when carbon escapes from swamp and moorland areas into the atmosphere and how nature's potential can be used to slow down climate change. ""European peatlands contain five times more carbon than European forests. It is therefore very important that the carbon remains in the peatland,” says Dr. Minna Väliranta from the Environmental Research Centre at the University of Helsinki. 

The researcher and her team are conducting field research to collect data on the effects of global warming on Arctic permafrost peatlands. Until now, there has been little data from the far north of Europe; many research findings from other regions have simply been generalized.

The demonstration against the rising cost of living on Sunday was called by the left-wing political opposition and led by the head of the France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Melenchon.
It was a show of anger against the bite of rising prices and to crank up the pressure on the government of President Emmanuel Macron.
Organisers called it a “march against the high cost of living and climate inaction”.

kLT72BGlJDo,"Carbon, cash, cattle and the climate crisis","This presentation was conducted by invitation from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in a workshop entitled ""Remodelling the Future of Agriculture: Building an Integrated Framework for Innovative Solutions for Agroecosystem Resiliency"". The presentation outlines a scientific basis for paradigm shifts in the way we conduct systems modelling together with actionable, novel opportunities for a way forward. The presentation covers:
1. The Australian livestock industry’s Carbon Neutral 2030 (CN30) Initiative
2. The nexus between productivity, profitability, greenhouse gas emissions and social licence under an increasingly variable climate,
3. Regenerative agriculture: implications for ecosystems services, biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions,
4. WaterCan Profit: avenues for the irrigated agricultural sector to improve profitability of irrigation water,
5. Earth observation and machine learning technologies for remote monitoring of agricultural management at the field (paddock) level
6. Participatory co-design processes
7. Place-based, people-centric research as a framework for adoption and impact
8. Transdisciplinary research programmes involving an array of disciplinary scientists, industry, policy-makers and others
9. The changing climate... or our climate crisis?
10. Reframing the focus to extreme weather events (droughts, heatwaves, extreme rainfall, bushfires) rather than gradual climate change
11. Community engagement and our duty to promote results without bias but also inspire confidence in the community
12. Opportunities associated with the climate crisis (livestock production in Tasmania, dairy production in northern USA, cropping in boreal areas with melting of permafrost regions)
13. On-farm trials with biochar as a livestock feed supplement to reduce enteric methane, improve soil carbon, improve liveweight gain and reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity
14. Frameworks for combining multiple models
15. ""Stacking"" (or combining) multiple greenhouse gas emissions interventions (e.g. soil carbon, plantation forestry, beef cattle herd management methods)
16. Effects of climate change on soil carbon sequestration
17. Mitigation opportunities that may be more favourable under future climate change compared with others
18. Soil carbon: management options for improvement, markets and policies
19. The integrated farm management method as a policy instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia
20. ""Carbon myopia"" and the urgent need to consider wider economic, environmental and social co-benefits and trade-offs associated with mitigation or adaptation
21. Prospective avenues for conceptualising, rethinking, applying and improving our systems modelling frameworks

Multiple communities were evacuated, major highways were closed, and train service was disrupted as authorities worked to gain control of the blaze.

The Jerusalem Post writer and breaking news editor Shir Perets, who reported on the fires Wednesday, joined the Post in studio for an update on the conflagration, and its connection to the climate crisis.

She also provided an update on what Israelis can expect from the rest of the hot season, and what other climate-related impacts could be felt this season.

Hillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.” As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains “by precept and example” the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",2021-02-24T18:31:52Z,UCudqVyQYnmi8NwWfd11Rmvw,Hillsdale College,"['hillsdale', 'politics', 'constitution', 'equality', 'liberty', 'freedom', 'free speech', 'lecture', 'learn', 'america']",491832,16156,4332,PT55M52S,27,none,650000,1164,168824948
0HQYORjp-9A,Climate change: Villages in Pakistan under threat of melting glaciers • FRANCE 24 English,"Pakistan is home to thousands of climate refugees. While the country contributes less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas, it is heavily impacted by the warming climate. One of the most affected areas is the autonomous province of Gilgit-Baltistan, located in northern Pakistan. It is known for its breath-taking landscapes made up of the majestic peaks of the Karakoram, the Himalayas, and the Hindu Kush mountain ranges. The province has thousands of glaciers that supply water to the valley floors and their millions of inhabitants, but the accelerated melting of the glaciers due to climate change has turned these ice giants into a threat. In recent years, thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes to seek refuge in cities across the province while hundreds of thousands still live under the constant threat of melting glaciers. Report by Shahzaib Wahlah with the collaboration of Nazim Baig and Sonia Ghezali.

SyavTWdSjm8,Why Canadians Are Paying for Other People’s Carbon Emissions,"Title: Why Canadians Are Paying for Other People’s Carbon Emissions
By: Long | Piping Design with Long

Are Canadians really the world’s carbon villains? Or are we the scapegoats?

In this video, I expose a hidden truth behind carbon taxes in Canada —
👉 That most of our emissions come from producing resources that we don’t even consume.
👉 That Canada is punished under a system that doesn’t count who uses the carbon, only where it’s made.

We’ll compare:

✅ Production-based vs. consumption-based carbon accounting
✅ Canada’s true carbon footprint after adjusting for exports
✅ How much CO₂ our forests actually absorb
✅ Why Canada might already be net-zero — but still gets blamed

🌍 Carbon justice needs accountability, not just accounting.
If you care about facts, fairness, and smart climate policy — subscribe now.

Do you think Canada should switch to consumption-based carbon accounting?

Summer used to mean mangoes, vacations, and cool breezes. But in South Asia, it's turning into a season of survival. From Delhi to Dhaka, rising temperatures are pushing past 45°C for weeks, bringing unbearable heatwaves, failed crops, and devastating impacts on human lives and ecosystems. In this video, we explore how climate change is stretching the summer months, disrupting monsoons, and creating deadly urban heat islands across cities like Lahore, Karachi, and Kolkata.

We'll dive into:
🔥 Why summers are getting longer and hotter
🌍 The science of greenhouse gases and global warming
🏙️ How urban heat island effects make cities unlivable
🧑‍🌾 The toll on farmers, laborers, and wildlife
🌱 Real community actions and green solutions across South Asia
❗ Why bold climate action is urgent — and what you can do

The Prime Minister refused to answer questions as he entered the Science Musuem in London about who will replace former clean growth minister Claire O'Neill, the president of the UN COP26 summit in Glasgow at the launch on Tuesday.

Ms O'Neill heavily criticsed Mr Johnson's approach as he prepared to outline new measures to tackle climate change, including a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles being brought forward to 2035.

xkGz4Vq-qgU,"Mac DeMarco on climate crisis, environmental art, and hot air balloons | A Future World","As part of Doug Aitken’s monumental New Horizons project, singer and multi-instrumentalist Mac DeMarco reflects on our place in nature and climate activism

Doug Aitken set out to create a flying sculpture for a project called Art in the Landscape funded by the conservationist society The Trustees. He designed a giant reflective hot air balloon which would travel down the Massachusetts coast line and stop in specific locations to create happenings; moments that would bring together speakers and musicians under the balloon to draw attention to the world we live in and the climate crisis we face. The piece came to be called New Horizons.

aZSRfraetQQ,Climate Crisis 2024: Breaking Points,"In this thought-provoking episode of the Climate Emergency Forum, host Herb Simmens explores the critical question: ""Climate Crisis 2024: Breaking Points."" Joined by distinguished regular panelists Dr. Peter Carter and Paul Beckwith, the panel delves into the alarming state of our planet's climate system and the multiple breaking points we face.

This video was recorded on January 8th, 2025, and published on January 14th, 2025, and represents the opinions of the discussion participants.

Dr. Carter presents sobering data on atmospheric CO2 levels, global temperature increases, and the weakening of carbon sinks. He emphasizes that we are ""beyond emergency"" and highlights the urgent need for immediate action to reduce global emissions. Paul Beckwith discusses the acceleration of temperature rise, the impact of shipping fuel changes, and the contrasting climate policies of different nations, noting China's significant strides in renewable energy adoption.

The conversation touches on various critical issues, including the potential collapse of the Amazon rainforest, the reconfiguration of ocean currents, and the emotional toll of climate anxiety. The panel stresses the importance of international cooperation and political will in addressing these challenges. Despite the grim outlook, they remind viewers to maintain hope and take care of their mental health while working towards solutions.

OXpuyjwoy78,Facing the climate crisis at Upper Conwy,"The dramatic terrain of Upper Conwy in the north of Snowdonia may look resilient and rugged but it's very vulnerable to climate change. Rivers travel the entire length of this landscape and increased rainfall means the area is at greater risk of severe flooding. Urgent work has been required to slow the flow of water from the mountains into the rivers. Together with our partners, we’ve restored over 2500 hectares of peatland, ensuring that water is held in the upper catchment for longer, improving its ability to store carbon and alleviate flooding downstream. 

Watch this video to find out how the National Trust and its partners are caring for the land. From reconnecting a section of river to its floodplain to restoring eroded riverbanks, a lot of measures have been taken to tackle climate change and protect local communities from flooding on their doorstep.

We protect and care for places so people and nature can thrive. Everyone can get involved, everyone can make a difference. Nature, beauty, history. For everyone, for ever.

ig9mMsEFxyM,My Biggest Project Ever!🌳 #shorts #shortsfeed #new,"We Planted Trees Where No One Else Would — Here’s What Happened

What if one small act could change the future of our planet? We traveled to one of the most forgotten corners of the earth and planted hope — one tree at a time. This isn’t just about planting trees; it’s about restoring balance, giving life back to dying soil, and rewriting the story of entire ecosystems.

Watch what happened when a handful of people said yes to healing the earth. Every view, like, and share helps this movement grow stronger.

The world needs more than words — it needs action. Let’s keep the roots growing.

Be part of the change.

3DOcQRl9ASc,Don't Choose Extinction - UNDP | United Nations | Jack Black | Climate Action,"The world spends an astounding US$423 billion annually to subsidize fossil fuels for consumers – oil, electricity that is generated by the burning of other fossil fuels, gas, and coal. This is four times the amount being called for to help poor countries tackle the climate crisis, one of the sticking points ahead of the COP26 global climate conference next week, according to new UN Development Programme (UNDP) research.

The amount spent directly on these subsidies could pay for COVID-19 vaccinations for every person in the world, or pay for three times the annual amount needed to eradicate global extreme poverty. When indirect costs, including costs to the environment, are factored into these subsidies, the figure rises to almost US$6 trillion, according to data published recently by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Instead, UNDP’s analysis highlights that these funds, paid for by taxpayers, end up deepening inequality and impeding action on climate change.

The main contributor to the climate emergency is the energy sector which accounts for 73 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel subsidy reforms would contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and benefit human health and well-being, and they are a first step towards correctly pricing energy – one that reflects the ‘true’ and full cost of using fossil fuels to society and the environment.

But UNDP’s analysis shows that fossil fuel subsidy reforms can also be unfair and harmful for households and society if they are poorly designed. While fossil fuel subsidies tend to be an unequalising tool - as the lion’s share of the benefits concentrate among the rich - these subsidies also represent an important portion of poor peoples’ incomes that otherwise must be paid for energy consumption. Fossil fuel subsidies’ removal thus could easily become an income- and energy-impoverishing strategy. This contributes to making fossil fuels reform difficult, and imposes a key barrier to transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources.

The Don’t Choose Extinction campaign features a collective intelligence platform, the Global Mindpool, to help tackle the most important issues of our time. Linking insights from around the world - on the climate emergency, the crisis in nature and inequality – the Global Mindpool will support UNDP to better inform and equip policy makers in government, civil society, and the private sector.

For more information on the ‘Don’t Choose Extinction’ campaign, visit www.dontchooseextinction.com

UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet.

The Arctic may seem like a frozen and desolate environment where nothing ever changes. But the climate of this unique and remote region can be both an early indicator of the climate of the rest of the Earth and a driver for weather patterns across the globe. William Chapman explains why scientists often describe the Arctic as the “canary in the coal mine” when it comes to climate change.

DNA: This time cold came to India late by about 15 days. The snow that falls on the mountains in January...fell in the beginning of February. In many countries of the world, the weather cycle seems to be changing. The only reason for this is global warming. But what we are going to tell you now can heat your mind. Because the world is heating up very fast. A study of the chemical records of sea sponges has come to light. What has been said in this study is a sign of great danger not for any one or two countries but for the entire world. Countries around the world have talked about limiting the temperature to one and a half degree Celsius by the year 2300. But according to the new study, when the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, the temperature had already crossed the level of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Not only this, it will reach 2 degrees Celsius by 2030.

Wei-Jen Huang (Distinguished Engineer) - Cisco

Antoine de Saint-Exupery said‚ ""A goal without a plan is just a wish"". If you don't know how to get to where you going- how do you ever get there?

Clearly- companies are all stating goal of achieving Net Zero by 2050 if not earlier. Annual reports have ESG declarations and goals; when we dig deeper- we find that everyone is making progress unreliability through experimentation. For example- company A made GHG reduction progress of 20% within the last 4 years- but looking closer at each year- the company would report 40%- 20%- 0%- 20% per year. Certainly relatively accurate but lacking a plan. Without a plan- the road to keep global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees C is far from certain. Goal of this talk is to share a 100 rule Circular Design Principle that charts a clear plan to achieve our goal to Net Zero by 2050 and beyond.",2024-10-23T02:36:53Z,UCXtmeGWbySLShhGV8ooyMzA,Open Compute Project,['#OCPSummit24'],1404,96,3,PT18M21S,28,none,17800,4832,1922960

leUbPS4zwZo,"Reducing Carbon Emissions With Nuclear Power with James O. Ellis, Jr.: Perspectives on Policy","As we move toward a low carbon, or even a zero-carbon future it is a mistake to completely rule out nuclear power. Nuclear is the only carbon-free way to generate baseload power. And replacing nuclear plants without renewable power capacity in place means that carbon emissions rise. With the right combination of renewables and clean nuclear power, we can completely de-carbonize our country’s electricity generation.

ujDlFJyBg7k,WATCH: Sen. King asks Gabbard why climate change was not included in latest worldwide threats report,"Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday why climate change was not included in this year’s worldwide threats report.

During a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, King said climate change has been included in past reports, noting how it’s a significant national security threat.

“Has something happened, has global climate change been solved?"" King asked.

“I can't speak to the decisions made previously, but this annual threat assessment has been focused very directly on the threats that we deem most critical to the United States and our national security,” Gabbard said. “Obviously we're aware of occurrences within the environment and how they may impact operations, but we're focused on the direct threats to American safety, wellbeing and security.”

King said climate change affects mass migration, famine and political violence.
When asked by the senator if she directed her team to leave out climate change in the report, Gabbard said she doesn’t recall giving that instruction.

Tuesday’s hearing, focused on worldwide threats, was held a day after the revelation that senior Trump administration officials discussed sensitive U.S. military attack plans in a Signal app group chat and inadvertently included a journalist.

The text chain, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discussed plans to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen, also included Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who also testified in the hearing . They were joined by FBI Director Kash Patel, NSA Director Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse.

In the time since the group chat was reported, national security experts and lawmakers have expressed concern about the major lapse in security.
When asked by reporters about the communications around the plans late Monday, Hegseth said “nobody was texting war plans.”

If our planet is going to survive the climate crisis, we need to act rapidly. We cannot wait for national governments to agree on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep the average temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees. In Solved, David Miller argues that cities are taking action on climate change because they can – and because they must. He makes a clear-eyed and compelling case that, if replicated at pace and scale, the actions of leading global cities point the way to creating a more sustainable planet.

Available from Aevo UTP, an imprint of University of Toronto Press

David Miller is the Director of International Diplomacy and Global Ambassador of Inclusive Climate Action at C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, where he is responsible for supporting nearly 100 mayors of the world’s largest cities in their climate leadership and building a global movement for socially equitable action to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

Temperatures had been expected to dip after being unusually high due to El Nino.

The Pacific Ocean weather phenomenon always pushes global temperatures higher than average, and it's counterpart El Nina causes temperatures to drop.

Man-made emissions are driving global warming, but even so, scientists cannot explain why January's temperatures were so high.

In this video I summarize the main pieces of evidence that we have which show that climate change is caused by humans. This is most important that we know in which frequency range carbon dioxide absorbs light, we know that the carbon dioxide ratio in the atmosphere has been increasing, we know that the Ph-value of the oceans has been decreasing, the ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere has been changing, and the stratosphere has been cooling, which was one of the key predictions of climate models from the 1960s.

Episode 1: The climate crisis is causing rising sea levels and nowhere is this more apparent than in the Isles of Scilly - a coastal UK area that’s just years away from being submerged. So I’m talking to Sir David Attenborough and other climate activists around the world about what we can do before it’s too late. …Or is it already too late?

5uxFxjMzufY,China’s Dam Slows Earth! #shorts,"What if I told you China’s mega-dam is literally SLOWING DOWN EARTH’S ROTATION? 

NASA confirms: Days are now 0.06 microseconds longer—and the planet’s axis has shifted 2cm! But the hidden environmental costs are even scarier...

✅ The Shocking Science:

- 10 trillion gallons of water in the dam = mass redistribution (like a skater extending arms).

- 2004 tsunami shortened days by 2.68 microseconds—same physics!

- Groundwater pumping has already shifted Earth’s axis 80cm since 1990.

✅ The Hidden Catastrophe:

- 3,429 earthquakes near the dam (2003-2009).

- 1.3 million people displaced + 632 km² flooded.

- The Yangtze River is poisoned by industrial waste.

✅ Future Domino Effect:

- Glacier melts could slow rotation further.

- Monsoon patterns may shift, disrupting agriculture.

- GPS/satellites will need recalibration.

Your Turn! Should mega-dams be banned despite their clean energy?

Comment ‘Stop Dams’ or ‘Worth It’!

r3vU_0w10o8,'Climate action seems to be a popular hobby for the rich',"Sky News host Chris Kenny says “climate evangelists” push a politicised climate agenda with a “zealotry” that trumps every other issue.

“All rational consideration seems to be pushed aside to focus on rampant climate alarmism” during domestic political battles over global warming policies, he said.

Mr Kenny said “irony” had entered the climate change debate with activists such as  Simon Holmes à Court, a renewable energy investor and supporter of political candidates who take an active approach to combating global warming. 

Simon Holmes à Court is the son of the late Robert Holmes a Court, Australia's first billionaire who made his fortune in the mining industry. 

According to Mr Kenny “it is more than a little ironic that a resources fortune derived at large from fossil fuels, is, at least in part, now being used to try to force other investors, workers and customers away from that very same industry sector.”

“Isn't it strange how some of the most active climate change evangelists are wealthy beyond our comprehension?""

“Climate action seems to be a popular hobby for the rich,” he said.

Embodied carbon refers to the emissions associated with the whole life cycle of building materials, from extraction to transportation and construction. As the world's largest architecture and design firm, we specify more building products than any other firm in the world. Our co-CEO Andy Cohen explains why we believe it is more critical than ever for our industry to understand what embodied carbon is, how it impacts the environment, and how the built environment can mitigate this risk.



As we pursue a path towards a net zero future, we are focusing on alternative materials — like mass timber — which have lower embodied energy and can help reduce the footprint of the materials we specify.

“What the ABC broadcast yesterday, Easter Sunday, was, and I’m speaking bluntly, taking the piss,” Mr Bolt said.

“They’re mocking Christianity at Easter, treating taxpayers as fools, and you should shame this man, ABC chairman Kim Williams, who I know, takes matters of faith very seriously. 

“On Easter Sunday, what did the ABC’s religious program Compass put to air? … it instead promoted a pagan faith … a secular religion, which I thought was an oxymoron, called Creation, which the ABC describes is a queer science fiction climate change religion.

In this video I explain what climate sensitivity is and why it is important. Climate sensitivity is a number that roughly speaking tells us how fast climate change will get worse. A few years ago, after various software improvements, a bunch of climate models began having a much higher climate sensitivity than previously. Climate scientists have come up with reasons for why to ignore this. I think it's a bad idea to ignore this.

UVf2Yw7uFoE,Global renewables: Pioneering the energy transition | DW Documentary,"We are facing the greatest upheaval since industrialization. To stop climate change, the energy system must be transformed worldwide. Very little time remains to accomplish this. But there are places where this renewable future has already arrived.

The documentary explores the question of what needs to happen in terms of politics, policies, and society to implement what is technically possible, when it comes to renewable energy. To do this, the film visits two completely different places. One is in the US and the other, in Bavaria. These localities have two things in common: Both have completely converted their energy supply to renewables and as a result, both now have more money in their coffers today than before.

The documentary provides a global overview of the solutions that already exist for a worldwide energy transition. And it asks what challenges still need to be overcome -- not only in the laboratories and power plants, but also among the movers and shakers who must drive the change today.

Raqo-8gwO6s,Inequality and Climate Breakdown: The Survival Paradox | Sean McCabe | TEDxDrogheda,"Climate chage requires a paradigm shift towards building low carbon, resilient societies and economies.Around the world, Trade Unions are embracing the concept of Just Transtition. A Just Transition requires early forecasting to predict social and economic risks of climate policy; social dialogue between workers, their employers and policy makers to build trust and plan for the transition; social security measures and training for those who are at risk of losing work; and economic diversification to ensure impacted regions can continue to exist. A Just Transition approach can foster the solidarity and empathy we require to achieve the target of the Paris Agreement and ensure we realise the potential of the Sustainable Development Goals. It provides the framework to tackle these global agendas at the local level and help us chart a course to a safer and fairer world. I am a scientist. For the past five years I have worked with former President Mary Robinson. Our work focused on climate justice and in my role as Policy Officer I participated in the negotiations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. I currently work with TASC, an independent think-tank whose core focus is addressing inequality and sustaining democracy. My work with TASC is focused on bringing deliberative democracy approaches to bear on the Just Transition in Ireland and Europe. I am also a candidate for the Local Elections in May 2019. I am running in the Cabra/Glasnevin ward in Dublin, on a platform focused on community participation, human rights and climate action.

AwwapYtzvcA,Azerbaijan’s unconventional opening speech at the UN climate change summit,"An annual account of CO2 pollution has found that this year's emissions from burning fossil fuels will likely exceed last year’s record levels.

The latest Global Carbon Budget, released at the UN's COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan, appears to dash hopes by some researchers of an emissions peak.

On day two of the meeting, tensions have been revealed over who should lead the world's transition away from fossil fuels.

CD7iYdtrJfY,Climate Action Needs New Frontline Leadership | Ozawa Bineshi Albert | TED,"We can't rely on those who created climate change to fix it, says climate justice organizer Ozawa Bineshi Albert. An Indigenous woman living in the heart of oil and gas country in the US, she's observed an alarming disconnect between empty promises made by corporations and the actual needs of communities on the ground. In this call for urgency and a shift in values, she advocates for climate policy to center frontline leaders and outlines some grassroots-led projects -- from water protection efforts in Minnesota to off-grid solar power in Arizona -- that have already sparked real change.

WynB_Hd5CnE,President Biden accuses Supreme Court of “devastating blow” against climate action - BBC News,"President Biden has accused the US Supreme Court of dealing a “devastating blow” against efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

In a landmark ruling the court said the federal government in Washington does not have powers to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of US power plants.  It means that policy can be decided by individual US states. 

The case against the US Environmental Protection Agency was brought by West Virginia on behalf of 18 other mostly Republican-led states and some of the nation's largest coal companies.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court sided with the conservative states and fossil-fuel companies.

Jane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by North America editor Sarah Smith.

k0j9heDD56Q,"Save water, Save energy - lowering carbon emissions in organisations & cutting future running costs","Saving water can save energy – helping lower Scope 1 and 2 emissions and cutting future running costs too. Using less hot water through small steps like tap aerators in kitchens and facilities, and cutting any areas of water waste also help. 

Plus, there’s a big 130% tax deduction currently available for organisations that invest in equipment including fittings in their buildings - so it’s a great time to look at water saving and go #OneStepGreener . And it all helps with #NetZero too!

As there’s carbon linked to the water you get through your site pipes and the wastewater that’s taken away – it’s worth looking closer at the water your organisation uses.

From providing expertise and installing hundreds of data loggers in 2021 – for organisations to see water use over a 24-hour period – and spot opportunities – to a tree-planting partnership to help, amongst other benefits, manage surface water that can cause extra flooding, we’re taking action as part of our Commitment to the Environment. And Water Plus is being recognised with a Green Apple Environment Award (in November 2021) for their awareness-raising about using water more effectively amongst customers, their employees and helping organisations cut water waste.

JZv0qxrs_LI,पर्यावरण तबाही टालने की कोशिश [Averting Climate Catastrophe] | DW Documentary हिन्दी,"पिछले 30 वर्षों में दुनिया भर में CO2 उत्सर्जन 60 प्रतिशत बढ़ा है. हमारी सभ्यता के सामने सबसे गंभीर समस्या ग्लोबल वॉर्मिंग है. क्या समाधान हो सकते हैं? यह डॉक्युमेंटरी जलवायु परिवर्तन से निपटने का प्रयास करते एक्टिविस्टों की कोशिशें दिखाती है. 

वैज्ञानिकों के अनुसार, अगर वर्ष 2100 तक वैश्विक तापमान, वर्ष 1850 में दर्ज स्तर से 1.5 डिग्री सेल्सियस से ज़्यादा बढ़ गया, तो परिणाम लोगों और पर्यावरण के लिए विनाशकारी हो सकते हैं. लेकिन क्या हम इस महत्वाकांक्षी लक्ष्य को हासिल करने में कामयाब होंगे? दुनिया भर में राजनेता, कंपनियाँ, रिसर्च लैब और विश्वविद्यालय समाधान खोजने के लिए संघर्ष कर रहे हैं. 

डॉक्युमेंट्री टीम सूडान, इंडोनेशिया और यूरोप में क्लाइमेट एक्टिविस्टों से मिलने जाती है. उपाय खोजने की उनकी कोशिशों के चलते उनकी खोज इमारतों को ठंडा करती है, देशों को हरित बिजली लाइनों से जोड़ती है या वातावरण से कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड को सोखती है. उनका काम, आने वाली पीढ़ियों की जीवन स्थितियों को तय करने में मदद करता है.

If you're outside of the US and want to watch the show, you can check it out on PBS.org: https://to.pbs.org/WeatheredINTL

This episode of Weathered: Earth’s Extremes was originally released on Oct, 2nd, 2024.

The AMOC is one of Earth’s most vital systems and it may be collapsing. Ocean scientist, Lisa Beal, has discovered that the Gulf Stream is slowing down, indicating a potential tipping point for the AMOC. In hopes to prevent an AMOC collapse, Maiya May heads to Georgia to meet Stacey Abrahms and learn how an ambitious non-profit hopes to electrify everything. She then travels to take her first flight lesson in an all electric plane. And finally she returns to Florida to learn about the final piece of the puzzle in reaching net-zero carbon emissions: nature.

Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.

p3bn-A-D2kU,Beyond extreme weather: How the climate crisis changes life on Earth | News Desk,"Extreme weather events are making the news more and more often, everything from droughts to floods. Climate change also affects us in other ways: shifting shorelines, declining agricultural productivity, food supply chains, water availability and population health. And whether you believe humans are the cause or not, it looks like our way of life is going to have to change. Depending on where you live the impacts of the climate crisis will be felt very differently. Can we adapt? Or are these trends reversible?

Without carbon dioxide, Earth's natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.

To combat this, I announced the Industrial Transition Accelerator alongside COP28 President Dr. Sultan al Jaber, United Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, and UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Climate Action and GFANZ Co-Chair Mark Carney.

Mike Bloomberg is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and three-term mayor of New York City. He serves as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions, and as WHO Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. Bloomberg graduated from Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School.

Bloomberg LP, the financial technology and media company he launched in 1981, revolutionized the investment industry and now employs some 20,000 people. His foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, works to improve lives through its core focus areas: Public Health, Education, the Environment, Government Innovation, the Arts, and Founders’ Projects including the Greenwood Initiative. He also launched a series of major efforts to help fight the coronavirus in the U.S. and around the world.

Watch more such talks on https://tedxgateway.com Aman is a wildlife conservationist and photographer from New Delhi. In 2019, he petitioned the Government of India to declare a national climate emergency on change.org, and asked them to carry out proposed climate policy reforms, collecting over 370,000 signatures on the petition. He then co-founded the ‘All In for Climate Action’ Initiative, a network of over 110 activists from across the globe who began climate emergency declaration petitions in over 70 countries, all asking for a worldwide Climate Emergency Declaration by global leaders. His campaign was selected to be presented by us at the UN’s first ever youth climate action summit, and now has a combined count of 1.7 million signatures.

TrTL1__4SvM,How can education really contribute to solving the climate crisis?,"“Debating the Futures of Education” is a video series produced by UNESCO, within the framework of an initiative that seeks to reimagine the futures of education. Here we ask viewers to think about how education can really contribute to solving the climate crisis.
 
The radical changes in today’s complex and uncertain world are transforming our understanding of, and approaches to, education and learning.  That is why it is crucial to rethink the nature of knowledge, the purpose of education, and the organization of learning. UNESCO has launched “Futures of Education”, a global initiative which aims to generate a global debate on how knowledge and learning can shape the future of humanity and the planet.
 
This video series “Debating the Futures of Education” aims to raise important issues that need to be discussed as we all work together to shape the futures we want: https://en.unesco.org/futuresofeducation/debates/videos

TSBC3rqhEbk,Why won't politicians save our climate? | Jessika Gedin & Yuval Noah Harari,"When it comes to looming climate disaster, are humans as helpless the dinosaurs were in the face of a massive asteroid 65 million years ago? According to the best estimates we have, the cost of avoiding the worst climate change outcomes is about 2–5% of global GDP. This is not an unrealistic amount of money: shifting even 5% of the budget from one field to another is something that politicians do all the time. So how come we're not doing this to tackle climate change?

cfRLU9FNHE0,Is There a Climate Crisis? Science vs. Politics | Anthony R. Lupo Interview by Graham H. Walker,"March 19, 2021

Overheated rhetoric has politicized and misinformed the public about the earth’s climate. Renowned physicist Dr. S. Fred Singer’s classic book on global warming—and antidote to unscientific claims—""Hot Talk, Cold Science"" has been updated and expanded (twice the size of the previous edition), incorporating numerous recent scientific findings, making this fascinating and complex subject accessible to general readers.

Dr. Singer passed away in April 2020, but not before updating and expanding his much-discussed book with the co-authors, and atmospheric scientist Anthony R. Lupo (University of Missouri) and climatologist David R. Legates (University of Delaware).

In this Lighthouse Briefing video, Dr. Lupo is interviewed by Independent Institute Executive Director Dr. Graham H. Walker. Merging recent developments in science, economics, and public policy, ""Hot Talk, Cold Science, Third Edition"" is a much-needed, peer-reviewed, de-coding book to a sprawling, highly technical literature, giving readers a clear understanding of what scientists and policymakers know about climate change—and what they don’t. The book allows independent thinkers to better detect and reason beyond the hyperbole and propaganda all-too-common in the politics and media coverage of this heated subject.

In the book, the authors explore the inaccuracies in historical climate data, the limitations on and failures of climate models, solar variability along with the effects of clouds, ocean currents, and sea levels on global climate, plus factors that could mitigate any human impact on world climate. This single book on climate science and policy serves as both an authoritative but accessible guide for both lay readers and those already versed in these complex and vital issues.

Dr. Anthony R. Lupo is a Research Fellow at the Independent Institute and Professor of Atmospheric Science and Principal Investigator of the Global Climate Change Group in the School of Natural Resources at the University of Missouri (MU). He received his PhD in atmosphere science from Purdue University, and he has been a Member of the Working Groups I and III for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Research Scholar at the Belgorod University in Russia, Fulbright Research Scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Associate Editor of the Monthly Weather Review, and Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University at Albany. He is the author of 135 peer-reviewed publications in major scientific journals, 277 conference pre-print papers, and the contributor to numerous scholarly volumes. Dr. Lupo is also the Chief Editor of ""Recent Developments in Tropical Cyclone Dynamics, Prediction, and Detection.""

RkPNbxmoDSU,Climate crisis: New carbon capture method revealed by scientists - BBC News,"A new method of removing carbon dioxide from the air and storing it in the sea has been outlined by scientists.

The new technique captures CO2 from the atmosphere up to three times more efficiently than current methods, according to researchers.

The idea sees the planet-warming gas transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored safely and cheaply in seawater.

Experts say widespread use of carbon capture technology will be required if the world is to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis.

The report examines the two prominent methodologies for calculating emissions: the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon accounting in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. By understanding these methodologies, we gain valuable insights into the carbon intensity variations across the supply chain of textiles and garments.

The primary purpose of this report is to shed light on where and why carbon emissions differ within the sector, providing essential insights into areas where decarbonization efforts should be prioritized. As we navigate through the complexities of the garment industry's carbon footprint, we aim to pave the way for sustainable strategies and actions to minimize environmental impact.",2023-07-31T05:42:38Z,UCrlcu5KChYyHwXlIeD7oLUg,International Labour Organization,"['ILO', 'International Labour Organization', 'OIT', 'ILOTV']",506,7,0,PT3M23S,29,none,202000,2614,1880501

icXNWOHsU1Q,A threat to human rights - The legal battle to stop climate change | DW Documentary,"Climate change is a threat to human rights. Court rulings are now making governments and businesses sit up and listen. Sitting back and doing nothing to stop global warming is becoming less and less of an option, as more and more citizens seek redress in the highest courts.

Top courts recently passed judgements forcing oil companies and governments to do more to prevent climate change. Up to now, the enormous power of the petrochemicals industry has gone largely unhindered. But some environmental organizations and activists are no longer prepared to accept that. Felix Ekardt, head of the Research Unit Sustainability and Climate Policy in Leipzig and Berlin, has filed several suits with Germany’s Constitutional Court. In his opinion, the German government’s Federal Climate Change Act is too lax. Judges at Germany’s top constitutional court agreed, in part, with Ekardt and his co-plaintiffs. They ruled that long-term measures were required to achieve zero emissions and that the German state needed to do more to achieve that goal. More and more environmental cases are coming before the courts - worldwide: There have been similar verdicts in France, the Netherlands and New Zealand. 

The Paris Agreement aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement is binding. But up to now the climate accord has not actually led to major structural change. The documentary shows what the latest court rulings mean for environmental policy and climate change. After all, climate change poses a risk to human rights.

Climate Action อีพีนี้ จึงไม่ได้มาเล่าให้ฟังแค่เทรนด์การตลาดความยั่งยืนที่กำลังจะมาในปี 2023 แต่จะชี้ให้เห็นถึงแนวทางในการลงมือทำจริง สำหรับผู้ที่ต้องการจะชูเรื่อง Sustainability เป็นคุณค่าหลักขององค์กร

rSMHqdg7cvA,Watch Live | Enhancing Energy Efficiency: How Technology is Cutting Carbon Emissions,"As world leaders meet in Dubai for COP28, here at home, the Biden Administration has set a goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. To do so, the U.S. will tap into provisions laid out in The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes a set of tax incentives, loans and grants to improve energy efficiency and climate resiliency. 

For consumers, it is the IRA’s Home Efficiency Rebate and High Efficiency Electric Appliance Rebate programs to purchase newer, more energy-efficient household appliances, and the adoption of power-saving technology, that will be felt most at home. In addition, the private sector plays a crucial role as the driving force of energy efficient innovation, designing new technologies and driving solutions that mitigate climate impact, reduce carbon emissions and empower consumers to make more sustainable choices. 

What can Americans do to tackle climate change and alter their carbon footprint?

Climate is defined as the weather conditions that characterize a given place. This includes temperature, humidity and wind, among other things. Each year is hotter than the last and the levels of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases continue to rise. For these and other reasons, the United Nations has made climate action one of its main sustainable development goals. Climate change is affecting all countries with no exceptions. Sea and ocean levels are rising and weather phenomena are becoming more extreme. We need to be aware of the climate change that our planet is undergoing, and we must try to minimize its effects as much as possible.

This video is a very useful and interesting resource for children. It is perfect for teaching what the Sustainable Development Goals are. It is an excellent video for primary education.

Lord David Puttnam produced award-winning films including Chariots of Fire, Bugsy Malone, and The Mission. He now works at the intersection between education, media, and policy. In 2007 he was appointed Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill.

Ez4qvsR-gHQ,U.N. Climate Action Summit: World leaders announce plans to tackle climate change,"Days after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered at the United Nations on Monday to try to inject fresh momentum into stalling efforts to curb carbon emissions.

Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Germany would double its contribution to a U.N. fund to support less developed countries to combat climate change to 4 billion euros from 2 billion euros.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country is determined to be the most ""sustainable food-produced in the world,"" while Indian Prime Minister Modi pledged to increase the country's renewable energy capacity. 

Over 60 world leaders and CEOs of energy and financial companies are expected to address the United Nations conference and announce climate finance measures and transitioning from coal power.

Re4Xo3X5xMo,How Does LCA Relate To A Building's Carbon Footprint? - Civil Engineering Explained,"How Does LCA Relate To A Building's Carbon Footprint? In this informative video, we’ll explore the relationship between Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a building's carbon footprint. LCA is a vital tool that evaluates the environmental impact of buildings throughout their entire lifespan. We will discuss how LCA encompasses various stages, from raw material extraction to manufacturing, construction, use, and disposal or recycling. 

Understanding the carbon footprint of a building is essential, as it highlights greenhouse gas emissions during these processes. However, LCA provides a wider perspective by examining additional environmental effects, which is important for civil engineers aiming to create sustainable designs. We’ll also cover the two primary applications of LCA in civil engineering: product-level assessments of individual materials and Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment, which evaluates the entire building system.

Additionally, we’ll touch on the practical applications of LCA in the design phase, sustainability reporting, and the role it plays in building demolition. By utilizing LCA, engineers can make informed decisions that reduce environmental impacts and support sustainable practices. Join us for an engaging discussion on how LCA contributes to a more sustainable future in civil engineering.

https://sc.mp/subscribe-youtube

Over the past 40 years, typhoons in Asia have become stronger and more destructive because of rising ocean temperatures, according to climate scientists. And based on most projections, severe storms are likely to become stronger and more frequent. Climatologists predict that by 2050, Hong Kong will be hit with at least one super typhoon, on average, every single year. Is the city of 7.69 million people doing enough to prepare for the coming climate crisis? To find out, the SCMP’s Alkira Reinfrank spoke with climate experts and people who had their lives turned upside down by the last super typhoon, Mangkhut.

We used calcined clay as a substitute for cement in concrete as part of our Diggers Rest Level Crossing Removal Project. 

Cement accounts for around 95% of concrete’s emissions, even though it only makes up around 15% of the mix. 

The clay can be sourced abundantly in Australia and produces very little CO2 when it’s calcined, making it a perfect cement alternative that keeps our projects solid while reducing our impact.

“We don’t only have to worry about warming,” the physicist argues. “It could very well be the climate gets colder. Nobody knows”—and we waste time arguing when we should be preparing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Freeman J. Dyson:

Freeman J. Dyson is Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Physics and Astrophysics in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He has taught as a professor at the Institute since 1953, prior to which he was a professor for two years at Cornell University. His work on quantum electrodynamics marked an epoch in physics, with the techniques he used in this domain forming the foundation for most modern theoretical work in elementary particle physics and the quantum many-body problem. He is also celebrated as an author on science and related topics; his books include ""Disturbing the Universe"" (1966), ""Weapons and Hope"" (1984), ""The Scientist as Rebel"" (2006), and ""A Many-Colored Glass: Reflections on the Place of Life in the Universe"" (2007).
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

Question: How do you currently rate the likelihood of climate catastrophe? 

Freeman Dyson:  Well that’s a big subject, of course, and I mean I don’t like the word catastrophe.  I don’t think there is any catastrophe there, but certainly the climate is changing and that’s important.  It’s always been changing.  There has never been a time when the climate stayed put for any length of time, and so I would say all the evidence we have is that we’re having some effect on the climate.  It’s not clear whether it’s good or bad.  It’s not clear whether it’s going to become a catastrophe or not and as far as I’m concerned it’s very foolish to do anything spectacular to…  What we should be doing is dealing with the problems in detail.  I mean the first thing is we should build dikes around New Orleans, and I mean there are simple practical things we can do which really would help, like building dikes around cities which are exposed to hurricanes or tsunamis and so these kind of practical measures could be enormously helpful.  I mean we’ve seen just in the last few months, we’ve seen two big earthquakes, one in Haiti and one in Chile, and what we’ve seen is that the earthquake in Chile was much larger, but the damage actually was smaller, the reason being that Chileans had taken more trouble to build buildings that would resist earthquakes and so you can… it actually helps enormously to strengthen your buildings.  Of course I mean Chile has the advantage of being a richer country to start with, but it’s a dramatic proof of what you can do.  You can actually take a natural catastrophe and reduce the damage by a factor of 100 or so just by quite simple measures; just by having good building codes and the same is true of climate.  There are all sorts of things we can do in a practical way.  It’s not -- we don’t only have to worry about warming.  We also have to worry about cooling, and it could very well be the climate gets colder.  Nobody knows, and there are many things we should be doing to prepare for that and they’re not all that expensive, but what I think is absurd, what I disagree with very strongly, is the idea that climate is predictable, that we can sort of do things 100 years in advance knowing what is going to happen.  That is just not…  That is just not the way it is.

Researchers in Australia say temperatures in and around the vast coral reef over the past decade are the highest recorded in 400 years.

Extreme heat has already caused five mass bleaching events in the past nine years alone.

Writing in the journal Nature the scientists behind the study said increased temperatures, driven by climate change, now pose an “existential threat” to this natural wonder of the world.

hZy244VaTds,Global warming solution found | TCC,"Visit TCC.LLA.IN to learn secrets to crack any exam

Global warming, driven by the rapid accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, is a pressing global challenge. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation have significantly increased atmospheric CO2 levels, trapping heat and causing a rise in global average temperatures. This has led to extreme weather events, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems.

To combat these effects, scientists are exploring innovative geoengineering methods to cool the Earth. One such proposal involves spraying diamond dust into the upper atmosphere. Diamonds, composed of pure carbon, are highly reflective. When finely ground into dust, they could act as tiny mirrors, scattering sunlight away from the Earth and reducing the amount of heat that reaches the planet's surface. This process, known as solar radiation management, could potentially lower global temperatures temporarily while humanity works to reduce CO2 emissions.

Unlike sulfur-based aerosols, which can cause acid rain and harm the ozone layer, diamond dust is inert and less likely to have harmful side effects. However, this idea remains experimental and raises concerns about costs, scalability, and unintended consequences. It underscores the urgent need for sustainable solutions to address global warming while minimizing environmental risks.",2024-11-22T05:01:44Z,UC8LQKvQviSRXGuz5wrXdmmw,The Curious Cobra,"['global warming', 'climate change', 'CO2 emissions', 'rising temperatures', 'geoengineering', 'diamond dust cooling', 'solar radiation management', 'atmospheric cooling', 'innovative climate solutions', 'global temperature control', 'climate crisis', 'environmental science', 'carbon emissions', 'sustainable solutions', 'cooling the Earth', 'climate engineering', 'reducing global warming', 'atmospheric science', 'reflective particles', 'climate innovation', 'tcc', 'the curious cobra']",26658,2948,56,PT1M,27,none,706000,332,213614011

The UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom is a crucial opportunity to achieve pivotal, transformational change in global climate policy and action. It is a credibility test for global efforts to address climate change and it is where Parties must make considerable progress to reach consensus on issues they have been discussing for several years. COP 26 comes against the background of widespread, rapid and intensifying climate change impacts, which are already impacting every region on Earth. Also, COP 26 comes against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the urgent need to build back better for present future generations to ensure a safe future.

The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.

Synopsis : 
Global warming refers to the long-term increase in the Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 

The most significant greenhouse gases contributing to global warming include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. 

These gases trap heat from the Sun in the Earth's atmosphere, creating a natural greenhouse effect that keeps our planet warm enough to support life.

However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 

This enhanced greenhouse effect intensifies the natural warming of the Earth, leading to global warming and climate change.

The consequences of global warming and climate change are far-reaching and impact various aspects of our environment and ecosystems:

Rising Temperatures: Average global temperatures have been steadily increasing over the past century, causing heatwaves and more frequent extreme weather events.

Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels: Higher temperatures lead to the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps, contributing to rising sea levels. This poses a threat to low-lying coastal areas and island nations.

Extreme Weather Events: Global warming increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and droughts.

Ocean Acidification: The absorption of excess CO2 by the oceans leads to ocean acidification, which negatively impacts marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells.

Biodiversity Loss: Many plant and animal species are at risk due to changing climatic conditions and habitat loss.

Human Health Impact: Global warming can affect human health by spreading infectious diseases, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses, and worsening air quality.

Addressing global warming requires collective action on both individual and global levels.

Some key solutions include:

Transition to Renewable Energy: Shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power.

Energy Efficiency: Improve energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Reforestation and Conservation: Protect and expand forests, as trees absorb CO2 and help mitigate the impacts of global warming.

Sustainable Agriculture: Promote sustainable agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance soil carbon sequestration.

International Agreements: Encourage global cooperation through agreements like the Paris Agreement, where countries commit to reducing emissions and limiting global warming.

So why do we treat it like dirt? Guardian journalist Josh Toussaint-Strauss finds out how we’re destroying the earth's soil, but also discovers some of the progress we've made in the race to protect it.

The Climate Action Challenge is a global design competition calling on designers to find solutions that help people adapt to climate change. It was launched at the What Design Can Do (WDCD) conference in Amsterdam in May, for which Dezeen is media partner.

""The theme of our conference this year is climate change,"" explains WDCD founder Richard Van Der Laken, in a movie produced by Dezeen for Autodesk.

""We are launching the Climate Action Challenge, inviting designers from the whole wide world to come up with proposals around climate change.""

The winners will be selected by an international jury to share an award package worth €900,000, which includes a production budget and an acceleration programme that will assist designers in developing their proposals.

SCqf_oVTMyM,Combating the climate crisis through community | Anna Hands | TEDxBloomsbury,"If your carbon footprint falls and no one is around to hear about it, does it make an impact? Communities can amplify our climate-positive actions as we share ideas and novel approaches. Further, discussing such actions with our wider communities shifts the cultural norm to bring change to places where we didn't think it was possible. However, if a community lacks empathy and/or diversity, it can prevent progress. So we need to nurture our communities as we would a plant, to promote new growth. 

Dr Anna Hands will talk about the benefits of community in bringing about the sustainable behaviour change necessary to tackle the climate crisis.  Dr Anna Hands is the director of the non-profit community organisation PPL PWR, which promotes sustainability and sustainable innovation through public engagement. She recently completed her PhD in Neuroscience at UCL and works as a Public Officer at the Academy of Medical Sciences, bringing together stakeholders from the public, private and governmental sectors to discuss societal health challenges. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Learn the basics about the effect of global warming on the environment.

Over the last 2000 years temperatures have varied, butt hat today, average temperatures are already one degree warmer on average than they were 100 years ago.

Some of the problems global warming may cause are changing climate, extremes of weather, problems for ecosystems, rising sea levels and ocean acidification. 

The greenhouse gases are causing average global temperatures to rise, with the rise being much more drastic in some places such as the northern polar regions. 

Patterns of rainfall will also change. Although a hotter world will have more water evaporated from the seas this water may not rain down as it does at present. Some places will undoubtedly have much more rain, causing flooding, whereas others may have less rain, causing droughts.

Another consequence of temperature change is that natural ecosystems will need to adapt...

4sn0ecqZgog,Is green hydrogen the answer to the climate crisis? | DW Documentary,"Green hydrogen produces zero emissions and many believe it holds the key to limiting global warming. So is it the big hope for the future or a multi-billion euro mistake?

Many believe green hydrogen could provide a miracle solution for countries around the world seeking to decarbonize their economies. But the technology is still in its infancy. Generating sufficient quantities of green hydrogen would require a lot more renewable energy than is currently available. Right now, almost all hydrogen is produced using natural gas in a process that generates large amounts of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, by contrast, is climate neutral. It's derived using renewable energy. The principle itself is not new but has, at yet, only found limited usage.
Engineers at the German Aerospace Center are now working with the world's largest artificial sun to try to produce hydrogen without any electricity at all, using only light. If they can succeed, it would allow large-scale production of this valuable gas in countries that receive a lot of sunshine. Hydrogen is already being used as a fuel for buses, trains and cars, with hydrogen-powered planes due to follow shortly.  Hydrogen is even the fuel of choice for space rockets, and German submarines glide along almost in silence thanks to hydrogen fuel cells. Manufacturers of airplanes, trucks, and even steel are investing millions in the technology, hoping that hydrogen will be the go-to fuel of a climate-neutral future. But critics warn of major challenges ahead, saying billions stand to be wasted.

""You're failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you,"" she added. Thunberg traveled to the U.S. by sailboat last month so she could appear at the summit. She and other youth activists led international climate strikes on Friday in an attempt to garner awareness ahead of the UN's meeting of political and business leaders.

Nearly 200 countries signed the agreement back in 2015, committing to limit the century's global average temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels. Carbon trading, the buying and sellling credits to emit CO2, is a big topic at the climate talks. Climatologist Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate and Research thinks that carbon trading would be an effective measure to curb emissions.

6r06-dpRsEg,How to reduce your carbon footprint by 80% | Matthew Tolley | TEDxTelford,"Governments worldwide have committed to a target of reducing Carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. European countries are aiming to go further and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
But the actions governments are collectively taking don’t look like they will be enough to meet their own targets. Matthew Tolley’s talk shows how you can, with your individual choices, have the power to reduce your carbon footprint from around 12 tonnes per year to 2.5 tonnes per year, with
little or no lifestyle compromises, and without waiting for governments or businesses to take action. All the steps are simple, actionable and nearly all of them will save money too. Matthew is a qualified Energy Efficiency Assessor for domestic and non-domestic (commercial) buildings. His business helps schools, charities and businesses in particular to save money by shifting to energy saving technologies, focusing on measures with have a payback period of less than 2 years.

Climate activists disrupted a DNC-adjacent event sponsored by ExxonMobil on Wednesday, the same day that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz formally accepted his nomination as vice-presidential candidate for the Democratic Party.

XZBh0j2s-4k,"How much is 1.5°C of global warming, really? (Quite a lot!)","#Climate scientist Daniel Swain ( @WeatherWest ) discusses why 1.5°C of #globalwarming is so immensely consequential for human and natural systems on Earth. 1.5°C may seem like a small temperature difference in a particular location on any given day, since it's likely less than the difference between today's and tomorrow's weather. But to put these numbers into perspective: the difference between recent Earth temperatures and the peak of the last Ice Age--when there were thousands of feet of ice (twice the height of a modern skyscraper) covering places that are today home to cities like New York and Chicago--was only around 6.0°C.

Xt-4dQqF7aU,How do corporations influence decisions on climate action?,"Climate action is a vote winner. Polls have shown that around the world, people have woken up to the threat which the climate crisis poses to their futures – and want their elected leaders to take urgent action to drastically reduce carbon emissions.

Yet at the same time, governmental action on climate change has been, at best, disappointing. Governments continue to pour billions of dollars of taxpayer money into fossil fuel subsidies, allow businesses headquartered within their borders to continue their polluting ways, and argue (against all evidence to the contrary) that fossil fuels will have a role to play in energy production for years to come.

So, what’s going on here? Why aren’t governments doing what their constituents overwhelmingly want them to do? The answer is: influence.

wf6VXXNjML0,Whoopi Goldberg’s Dramatic Call for Climate Action | Extinction Rebellion,"Whoopi Goldberg has teamed up with Extinction Rebellion in a beautiful new animation set in the future, entitled 'The Gigantic Change'. The film, released as part of World Environment Day, looks back from 2050 to show how people came together to save the world from the climate and ecological crisis.

Visit https://www.thegiganticchange.com to find out how you can take action today.

As we start to plan how to rebuild our world post-Covid, the film shows that a brighter future really is possible. But this won’t happen on its own; we must all take action today. The climate and ecological crisis is an existential threat to people of all ages and backgrounds. The need for collective action has never been greater.

The team behind The Gigantic Change, together with Passion Pictures – who created the famous Orangutan advert for Iceland – knew that Whoopi’s iconic voice would bring a perfect sense of gravitas to the performance. She is a prominent campaigner on environmental issues, so she had the power to inspire many of her followers to take action.

The urgency of the situation clearly resonates with her, and many others, but the challenge is to communicate this urgency to the wider public. This is the primary purpose of The Gigantic Change. After seeing the film, viewers are invited to visit https://www.thegiganticchange.com, a simple website outlining the most effective actions they can take to save the environment. 

Whoopi Goldberg has appeared in such films as The Color Purple, Ghost, and Sister Act. She became the first African American woman to host the Academy Awards and only the second African American woman to actually win one. Today she has a strong voice on climate issues and is an active supporter of the School Strikes.

Statistical correction:
It has come to light that the statistic referenced at 02:33 in the film is from a scientific paper which is now outdated. Instead of 'almost half of all species on Earth will be extinct’, a more accurate current estimate is 'up to 1 million more species could be extinct, due to human activity’.

WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?
Here's a simple definition of global warming. (And yes, it's really happening.) Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. And experts see the trend is accelerating: All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have occurred since 2000.
Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but several recent studies, including a 2015 paper published in the journal Science, have disproved this claim. And scientists say that unless we curb global-warming emissions, average U.S. temperatures could increase by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.

WHAT CAUSES GLOBAL WARMING?
Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally, this radiation would escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.

HOW IS GLOBAL WARMING LINKED TO EXTREME WEATHER?
Scientists agree that the earth’s rising temperatures are fueling longer and hotter heat waves, more frequent droughts, heavier rainfall, and more powerful hurricanes. In 2015, for example, scientists said that an ongoing drought in California—the state’s worst water shortage in 1,200 years—had been intensified by 15 percent to 20 percent by global warming. They also said the odds of similar droughts happening in the future had roughly doubled over the past century. And in 2016, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine announced that it’s now possible to confidently attribute certain weather events, like some heat waves, directly to climate change.

The impacts of global warming are being felt across the globe. Extreme heat waves have caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world in recent years. And in an alarming sign of events to come, Antarctica has been losing about 134 billion metric tons of ice per year since 2002. This rate could speed up if we keep burning fossil fuels at our current pace, some experts say, causing sea levels to rise several meters over the next 50 to 150 years.

WHAT ARE THE OTHER EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING?
Each year, scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming, and many agree that environmental, economic, and health consequences are likely to occur if current trends continue. Here’s just a smattering of what we can look forward to:

• Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic water shortages and increase the risk of wildfires in the American West.
• Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern Seaboard, especially in Florida, and in other areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.
• Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy downpours, and increased flooding. All those factors will damage or destroy agriculture and fisheries.
• Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many plant and animal species to extinction.
• Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common due to increased growth of pollen-producing ragweed, higher levels of air pollution, and the spread of conditions favorable to pathogens and mosquitoes.

IS GLOBAL WARMING TOO BIG OF A PROBLEM FOR ME TO HELP TACKLE?
Wondering how to stop global warming? Reduce your own carbon footprint by following a few easy steps. Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. When you shop for new appliances like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, look for products with the government’s Energy Star label; they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal requirements. When you buy a car, look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions. You can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible.
And while new federal and state standards are a step in the right direction, much more needs to be done. Voice your support of climate-friendly and climate change preparedness policies, and tell your representatives that transitioning from dirty fossil fuels to clean power should be a top priority—because it’s vital to building healthy, more secure communities.

Wheat, in contrast, may see an uptick in crop yields by about 17%. The change in yields is due to the projected increases in temperature, shifts in rainfall patterns and elevated surface carbon dioxide concentrations due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, making it more difficult to grow maize in the tropics and expanding wheat’s growing range.

20:45 The Theory

1:45:40 Conclusion

""We have to move quickly. What we do, I believe, in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity"". Sir David King. Former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government. 

Given there is a real world out there and we have 3-4 years to stop it being destroyed, we have to engage in nonviolent direct action to stop governments imposing upon us the greatest act of criminality in the history of humanity: namely destroying the livelihoods and lives of the next thousand generations. This video gives you the key elements of success which people are adapting as they step into their responsibilities to force political change. Nothing is more important. We can not longer afford to lose. 

""We struggle to name any climate scientist who at that time thought the Paris Agreement was feasible. We have since been told by some scientists that the Paris Agreement was “of course important for climate justice but unworkable” and “a complete shock, no one thought limiting to 1.5°C was possible”. Rather than being able to limit warming to 1.5°C, a senior academic involved in the IPCC concluded we were heading beyond 3°C by the end of this century.""

Zmnlw6SBNL8,Fight Climate Anxiety with Climate Action Today,"Learn how to turn climate anxiety into effective climate action with this video! This a video focused on practical climate action tools with many climate action resources. With the ongoing climate crisis, it is easy to feel climate anxiety and even hopeless but action is our only way out. This is a video to encourage hope and optimism based in climate action. 
This video has also been featured on @OurChangingClimate. 

With ecosystems around the world being destroyed, the sixth mass extinction going on, more intense hurricanes and heatwaves, and the average global temperatures rising- it is natural to feel extremely anxious and even spend sleepless nights worrying about our future.  There is a real term for this suffering and fear for our survival - climate anxiety. The question of how to turn climate anxiety into climate action is described in detail in this video. This is a practical climate action resource with detailed tips and tools. 

A team from the University of Bath surveyed 10,000 children and young people (aged 16-25 years) in ten countries for climate anxiety.  Nearly 60% of the respondents were extremely worried about climate change and felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. 

We can make a difference in climate action via Project Drawdown and Projection Regeneration solutions. We discuss how to find your climate career using tools such as Climatebase, Work on Climate, and Terra.do. The video also features @ClimateTown for his eloquent description of organizations to join for climate action. Check out his channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVLG9pThvBABcYCm7pkNkA

QjkUDAmn2-I,Euronews Debates: How can Europe fight the climate crisis? Experts answer,"During Euronews' special #GreenWeek, our journalist Damon Embling held a virtual debate on the future of water, and how Europe can fight the climate crisis.

Global access to clean water, why are women and girls so badly affected by water scarcity or technology being a solution to tackle the changing face of agriculture were the many topics discussed during this live event.

The guests were WaterAid's Global Director of Policy and Campaigns Sol Oyuela, Novagric's Director of Research & Development Department Juan Pardo Martinez, Belgian MEP and Member of the Parliamentary Group on Water Assita Kanko and Head of the School of Geography and Environmental Science at University of Southampton Professor Justin Sheffield.

A great thank you to our audience and they learned questions.

7p0HdzZsdII,Is Global Warming Speeding Up?,"Thanks to climate change, 2023 has shattered heat records, and 2024 is continuing where last year left off. With this devastating heat driving extreme weather - from heatwaves to downpours to wildfires - across the globe, scientists are increasingly asking if global warming could be accelerating. So what does the evidence show? Is the heating up of our planet speeding up? If so, what does this climate change mean for our future? And can we still hit the brakes and halt global warming?

Lecture by Dr. Mike Hulme: Beyond Climate Solutionism

Dr. Hulme is professor of human geography and fellow of Pembroke College, University of Cambridge

Climate change is not only a natural phenomenon; it is also a cultural and social phenomenon. How do we reframe the adjustments that climate change demands of us by drawing upon the work of researchers beyond the sciences?

The speakers discuss and take questions at the 55th annual Nobel Conference (Climate Changed) at Gustavus Adolphus College in 2019.

The Nobel Conference: Science and Ethics, in Dialogue
Since 1965, the Nobel Conference has been bringing leading researchers and thinkers to Gustavus Adolphus College in Saint Peter, Minnesota, to explore revolutionary, transformative and pressing scientific issues and the ethical questions that arise alongside them. 
As the only event in the United States authorized by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden to use this name, it is our privilege to host a space in which we can talk about big scientific questions, and the big ethical issues to which they inevitably give rise. The world needs more people who think critically about the crucial issues of our time, and who ask questions in ways that open up the conversation.

a5rflVwfEP4,"Noam Chomsky and Robert Pollin on the Climate Crisis, Capitalism, Trump, and the Green New Deal","Professors Noam Chomsky (MIT) and Robert Pollin (UMass) in conversation with Dr. Donna Lyons at the School of Law, Trinity College Dublin, on their new book, ‘Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal’.

-------------------------

About 'Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal': 

In this compelling new book, Noam Chomsky, the world’s leading public intellectual, and Robert Pollin, a renowned progressive economist, map out the catastrophic consequences of unchecked climate change—and present a realistic blueprint for change: the Green New Deal.    

Together, Chomsky and Pollin show how the forecasts for a hotter planet strain the imagination: vast stretches of the Earth will become uninhabitable, plagued by extreme weather, drought, rising seas, and crop failure. Arguing against the misplaced fear of economic disaster and unemployment arising from the transition to a green economy, they show how this bogus concern encourages climate denialism.   

Humanity must stop burning fossil fuels within the next thirty years and do so in a way that improves living standards and opportunities for working people. This is the goal of the Green New Deal and, as the authors make clear, it is entirely feasible. Climate change is an emergency that cannot be ignored. This book shows how it can be overcome both politically and economically.

---------------------

Dr. Donna Lyons is an academic with the Trinity College Dublin Law School. Her research focuses primarily on public international law and international human rights law. 

I was delighted to welcome three colleagues to join with questions. Many thanks to Jason, Constantine, and Peter, who agreed to do this. 

Dr. Jason Rudall is Assistant Professor of International Law at Leiden University, having a particular interest in international environmental law and has recently published a book entitled Compensation for Environmental Damage Under International Law (Routledge 2020).

Dr. Constantine Boussalis is Assistant Professor of Environmental Politics and Quantitative Methods in the Political Science department at Trinity College Dublin.  His research focuses on the application of computational methods to study political communication, including climate change denial and misinformation.

Prof. Peter Stone is an associate professor of political science at Trinity College Dublin and the author of the book The Luck of the Draw: The Role of Lotteries in Decision Making (2011).

Thanks everyone for your interest and I look forward to seeing you all at future discussions!

7A7JjJmvx08,Why the climate crisis is an issue of injustice and inequality,"In a climate justice special episode of the podcast, the biggest issue of the century is up for discussion. Find out the true impact of climate change on our planet and who should be paying to fix the crisis.

Rowan Hooper and Madeleine Cuff are joined by two climate experts - Friederike Otto and Joyce Kimutai from the World Weather Attribution project at Imperial College London.

This episode is dedicated to answering three questions - starting with the issue of climate attribution. To what extent can we blame climate change for extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, floods and wildfires? Find out how climate attribution began as a fringe science and how it has evolved to become a firm part of public consciousness.

The next question is one of climate justice - how can we make sure rich countries pay for the loss and damage caused to poorer countries by climate change? The argument is that poorer nations are least responsible for climate change, yet they are most affected by its impacts. So at the latest UN climate summit, COP28, a lot of money was pledged - yet hardly any of it has actually materialised. So what’s going on?

And the third question is about litigation - can climate attribution be used to achieve justice, by forcing climate polluters to pay up? A trial is ongoing where a company in Germany is being sued for its role in damaging the climate - but it’s still unclear whether the case will be successful. The hope is with climate attribution, it’ll be easier to bring cases like this forward and offer up a more detailed picture of how much damage has been done - and how much money is owed.

The new directive will enforce policies designed to boost jobs and health – including a plan to buy clean, zero emission vehicles made by Americans in America. 

The plan is expected to create one million jobs in the automobile sector. 

The Biden administration will also take steps to achieve a 100 per cent carbon emission free electric sector by 2035.

“We’re talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air and cleaner communities,” Mr Biden said. 

“We desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis.”

Definition of climate change
Climate change usually refers more specifically to anthropogenic climate change, meaning the rapid rate at which the temperature of our planet and its atmosphere have been increasing over the past century due to human activity, in particular since the industrial revolution. It is NOT about individual weather events, although climate change can result in large-scale shifts in weather patterns.

Causes of climate change
Some gases present in our atmosphere make it work like a greenhouse so we call them greenhouse gases (GHG): The higher their concentration, the more they trap heat. This is great for starting your tomatoes during a chilly spring but this is not good for human beings on this planet. These greenhouse gases include the well known carbon dioxide of course but also methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, HFCs), etc. Since the industrial revolution, we have been burning a lot of fossil fuels (such as oil, coal and natural gas), therefore our human activities have contributed to a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, from 280 ppm in 1750 to 415 ppm in 2019. But there is a correlation between CO2 concentration and temperatures (as we found out in my video about ice cores in Antarctica) therefore as CO2 emissions increase so does the global average temperature on Earth.

Ok, so greenhouse gases cause climate change but more precisely, which sectors are these emissions coming from? The Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) breaks down our carbon emissions like this. A few things are interesting here. Although GHG emissions and climate change are often pictured as cars and airplanes, you can see that it would be more accurate to draw them as fields, steaks, concrete buildings with heaters and air conditioners and factories building things as these three sectors combined represent about 76% of our global GHG emissions. Although we often talk about emissions, another issue from a climate change perspective is the reduction of carbon sinks, like deforestation which reduces CO2 absorption.

A few things make this a little more complicated. Firstly: The rise in temperature has a lot of inertia, meaning it is not going to stop overnight even if we stopped our emissions today. Secondly: Positive feedback loops: smaller white surfaces on the planet reflect less the rays of the sun resulting in more heat absorption. Also, the hotter it gets, the more air conditioning we use. We saw this is already a major challenge but it is also an opportunity as we’ll see in a minute. Thirdly: the permafrost conceals huge amounts of methane which would act like a climate bomb if liberated.

The implications for us humans are numerous: more catastrophes such as forest fires, hurricanes, tsunamis, draughts, viruses like Covid-19 and sea level rise resulting in refugee crisis, conflicts, loss of crops and biodiversity, diseases and economic downfall. In a 2016 report, the IPCC strongly suggested keeping the global warming under 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels to avoid dramatic outcomes. Even it it does not look like much, 1.5° makes a big difference on planet Earth!",2021-07-09T14:30:26Z,UCB_yeT6WwVLJjCsZFt2oQfA,Sustainability Illustrated,"['climate change', 'climate change causes', 'climate change definition', 'climate change solutions', 'causes', 'definition', 'solutions', 'project drawdown', '2021', 'drawing of climate change', 'sustainability', 'environment', 'whiteboard animation', 'sustainability illustrated', 'education', 'Climate change 2021: definition causes & top 10 solutions', 'what is climate change? start here', 'Is It Too Late To Stop Climate Change?', 'Causes and Effects of Climate Change', 'climate change 101', 'climate', 'global warming']",55211,1130,125,PT8M34S,27,none,71100,107,7042857

We follow Fiona as she prepares for Cop27 in Egypt, asking presidents, global leaders, activists and scientists if global diplomacy is enough to save humanity from the brink of annihilation

ZResbDgj8b8,Climate change or climate hoax? Skeptics and activists | Us & Them | DW Documentary,"Climate change is real, and it is dangerous. Some people are actively trying to stop it. Others deny or intensify it - or suppress information. Most don’t bother at all and continue to contribute to global warming through their lifestyle.

Anja Windl from Germany is a climate activist with a group called ""The Last Generation."" They take dramatic action in order to draw attention to climate change. Time and again, they have glued themselves to streets, defaced works of art and private planes, or loudly disrupted events. In Anja's opinion, politicians, business leaders and the majority of citizens in affluent Germany are all failing to do enough to combat climate change. Yet the country is a major contributor to global warming, Anja says. 

For Thorsten Alsleben, the activities of climate activists are nonsensical and even dangerous. The managing director of the ""Initiative New Social Market Economy"" - a lobbying organization founded by German industrial companies - does not deny that climate change exists. However, he warns against governmental policies that stifle Germany's economic strength. In his opinion, the free market and a carbon tax will serve to ensure companies produce in more climate-friendly ways. Moreover, he says, Germany only contributes around 2 percent to greenhouse gas emissions - much less than front-runners China or the US. 

Some 9,200 kilometers away from Germany, 38-year-old Anto Purnomo takes his boat through the mangrove forests of Langsa, in the north of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. He makes his living by felling mangroves and selling the wood. Mangroves bind CO2. But more importantly, the plants are key to coastal protection and home to valuable ecological systems, countless fish, and other marine animals. He knows about climate change, but he has to feed his family. 

Taufik Hidayat, on the other hand, is trying to stop the deforestation of the mangroves. He knows how important they are for the people and nature of the coastal regions. If sea levels continue to rise due to global warming, the mangroves can at least provide some protection. The 24-year-old works for the NGO Indonesian Coastal Conservation Foundation in Langsa, Aceh. His father, a crab fisherman, already warned him about of the dangers to locals if the mangroves continue to disappear. Taufik is aware that everyone has to fight climate change in their own way. But he also knows that people in the wealthy industrialized countries have a special responsibility.

h33Sc3Z9sr4,Local Climate Change Action Planning in the Philippines,"A video on how local governments in the Philippines can take action against climate change.  

*long version*

The video was produced by UN-HABITAT Philippines: http://unhabitat.org.ph/, for the Department of Interior and Local Government – Local Government Academy. It was produced in the framework of the Vertical Integration and Learning for Low Emission Development (V-LED) project. To find out more about the V-LED project visit: https://localclimateaction.org 

The Philippines economic growth in recent years, mostly occurring in cities and urban areas, brought greater opportunities such as better public services and enhanced social equity. This growth, if not managed properly and when done unsustainably, will lead to problems like congestion, greater air pollution, and higher demand for energy. With this urbanisation trend, comes rising greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change that brings in stronger typhoons, increased rainfall and long dry spells. If not addressed, socio-economic activities of both families and communities will be affected - making it crucial for government leaders to take adaption and mitigation actions to avoid the devastating impact of climate change. 

Local leaders should ensure that investments consider the environment to provide quality of life for all, now and in the future. Low emission development lowers GHG emissions and ensures climate compatible and resilient development, leading to economic, social and environmental benefits. It ensures that developments are resilient against a changing climate. 
The Philippines submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change with the aim of reducing GHG emissions in agriculture, waste, industry, transport, forestry and energy. Although a nationally let process, the transition to low emission development needs to mobilise the emission reduction potential at the local level.

Agriculture, waste, industry, forestry, transport and energy contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. These sectors are covered in the Nationally Determined Contributions or NDC. As frontline institutions Local Government Units (LGUs) can transition to action plans that support vertical integration and learning a low emission development. This dimension in planning is necessary to stimulate urban climate actions. 

Local governments formulate Local Climate Change Action Plans LCCAP which are integrated into or derived from long term plans like the CLUP and CDP. Using local planning processes your LGU can integrate adaptation and mitigation policies in every step of your development.

While national leadership establishes the policy framework for achieving climate resilient and low emission development, you enforce these policies and decide your resources. LGUs formulate land use plans and enforce zoning ordinances, governing urban sprawl. 

With low emission development, your LGU can reduce energy costs, address local pollution and lower carbon emissions while improving local economy and creating new businesses and job opportunities. 

Your locality has much to gain from taking concrete actions to achieve low emission development: reduce health impacts from air pollution, sustainable energy from more secure and cheaper energy supplies reduce poverty and enhance safety; access to climate action funding such as the green climate fund, adaption fund and people survival fund. 

The multiple benefits of climate action is a win-win situation for climate protection and local development. In fact there are local government units which are already demonstrating leadership for bringing down emissions. One example is the diversion of waste into compost used to grow plants and crops, and processing of garbage into alternative fuels. 

There are more examples from other LGUs that have also transitions towards this development model with the assistance of various programmes and using tools and resources for integrating low emission development into planning and decision making. Such as the USAID Philippine B-Leaders in partnership with the Climate Change Commission; the CCC Low Emission Capacity Building PHL Project; the Urban LEDS implemented by the United Nation Human Settlements Programme in Partnership with ICLEI and EU; the V-LED project, implemented by UN Habitat in partnership with adelphi and support from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety. 

How do you start? You start by including GHG inventory and management into your local plans. Investment programmes and budget processes with the end goal of producing sustainable solutions. 

Your responsibility is clear: addressing emissions needs to be an integral part of your development planning and investment programming with meaningful participation from all stakeholders, with your city and other local governments leading the way.

Never before in human history have we been richer, more advanced or powerful. And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of rapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun and transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them. 

So why don’t we just like… prevent all of that? Well, it’s complicated.

Let’s quantify this—and let’s consider structural design choices that can minimize CO2e emissions.

Did you know that for every S$10 you spend at a fast food restaurant, you're producing about 5kg of carbon emissions? That'll require 40% of a tree to absorb it per year - and that's just for one meal! 

Find out how you can also decrease your carbon footprint, and offset unavoidable carbon - all within the app.

IHolLQWD_oY,Korea to cut carbon emissions by 37% by 2030,"2030년 온실가스 감축목표 37%…산업부문 11.7% 줄인다

The Korean government has OKed a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 37-percent by 2030. 
The power generation sector will see the biggest blow with a reduction of more than 19-percent. 
Our Lee Minyoung reports. 
Korea mapped out a new plan to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent,...or 3-point-15 million tons, by 2030.
This road map, approved by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, comes on the heels of the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change led by the United Nations and which entered into force in Korea on December 3.
To minimize the impact on the economy, the government decided to keep the reduction rate below 12 percent in the industrial sector.
To break down the numbers,...
At home, the government plans to cut 64-point-5 million tons solely in the country's power generation sector, while the industrial sector will have to meet the target of reducing 56-point-4 million tons of carbon emissions as well. 
Buildings will also decrease their carbon emissions by 35.8 million tons and the energy sector will have to cut back emissions by more than 28 million tons. 
The government says it will strictly ban the construction of new coal plants and increase the supply of green energy that uses renewable sources, such as solar power.
The ministry said it will double its scheduled renewable portfolio standard,...or RPS...which requires electricity supply companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy sources when producing energy,.... to 7 percent by 2020.
The rate is currently set at three and a half percent.
The public sector will inject more than 950 million U.S. dollars into R&D in the clean energy field by 2020,...and companies will also be given more emissions rights when they invest more on eco-friendly facilities.

cKMEkZ9Opj0,There's 'virtually zero' chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C says UN,"This year's Emissions Gap Report by the UN says the chances of limiting global warming to 1.5C is “virtually zero”.

Signed by 196 countries, The Paris Agreement was set up to limit global warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels and prevent it from rising beyond 1.5C.

However, the report finds that greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were the highest on record and that the planet is on course for 3.5C of warming this century if countries continue at their current trajectory.

hwiv_nMUplM,Superstorms and Global Warming: Is Extreme Weather the New Normal? | SLICE EARTH | FULL DOCUMENTARY,"Every year, the tropics face the planet's most powerful storms—known as typhoons in the Pacific, cyclones in Australia, and hurricanes in the Atlantic. Despite their different names, these weather systems are born from nearly identical conditions and are among the most dangerous natural events on Earth.

Hurricanes alone claim thousands of lives and cause billions in damage annually. But even with all our technological advancements, their sudden intensifications remain a mystery. These storms can rapidly escalate to deadly strength in just a few hours, leaving scientists puzzled about the precise causes.

The summer of 2017 was a turning point, as the Caribbean experienced a relentless barrage of hurricanes, with more catastrophic landfalls than ever before. Islands were devastated, entire nations faced humanitarian crises, and the unprecedented rainfall left a lasting impact. As global warming and rising sea levels continue to influence our climate, scientists warn that these super-storms could become the new normal.

YhApYWr_R8o,Why haven’t we been able to stop the climate crisis?,"Svanfridur Mura shares how changing how we think about future generations could be the key to solving climate change. 

—

Climate change is the foremost issue of our time, yet not enough is being done to stop it. Why is that? Svanfridur Mura believes the answer lies in how humans think and plan for the future— we tend to focus on the short-term, when we need to be thinking about the long-term survival of the human species. In this Talk, Svanfridur details how three major revolutions in human history have enabled our survival and how ""it's our turn now to adapt again.""

FQDniBcyntc,Make your actions on climate reflect your words | Severn Cullis-Suzuki,"Take action on climate change at http://countdown.ted.com.

""History has shown us that in moments of crisis, society can truly transform,"" says environmental educator Severn Cullis-Suzuki. Nearly 30 years ago, at just 12 years old, she spoke at the UN's Earth Summit in hopes of reversing the planet's slide into ecological disaster. Some at the summit listened and took radical action, but for the rest of the world, it was business, politics and full-steam-ahead economic growth. Now, Cullis-Suzuki shares another warning about the future, this time informed by the COVID-19 crisis -- and urges us all to make our actions on climate change reflect our words.

This talk was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020. (Watch the full event here: https://youtu.be/5dVcn8NjbwY.) Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world. Get involved at https://countdown.ted.com/sign-up

dY9Ks6reqa8,U.S. unveils plan to reduce carbon emissions by 2030,"The Obama administration has announced an ambitious plan to significantly reduce carbon emissions in the U.S. plant sector.
Supporters of the plan say it'll give Washington greater leverage to push countries like China and India to do more to fight climate change.
Choi You-sun reports. 
""Today, EPA is proposing a Clean Power Plan that will cut carbon pollution from our power sector, by using cleaner energy sources, and cutting energy waste.""

The Obama administration's new plan requires America's 1-thousand power plants to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to 30 percent of 2005 levels by the year 2030.
Nearly two-fifths of electricity in the U.S. is generated by coal-fueled plants.
Each U.S. state has a number of ways to achieve this.
They can increase their power plants' heat rates, rely more on natural gas or other sources for energy, and raise energy efficiency.
The Environmental Protection Agency says more than 90 billion U.S. dollars of climate and health-related costs will be saved from the plan and up to 150-thousand asthma attacks in children and over 3-thousand heart attacks could be prevented.

""Often these illnesses are aggravated by air pollution, pollution from the same sources that release carbon and contribute to climate change. We've got to do more to reduce it.""

Despite the government's assurances that the new rules will bring down electricity bills by eight percent and encourage investment in new technologies, business groups and lawmakers from coal-reliant states oppose the initiative.

""The administration has set out to kill coal and its 800-thousand jobs. If it succeeds, we'll all be paying a lot more electricity.""

After a period of public comment, the regulations will be finalized in June of next year, after which states can submit their own carbon reduction plans.

siJgcqeeHrM,WATCH: Sen. Bernie Sanders asks Zeldin if climate change is a hoax,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked Lee Zeldin, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for director of the Environmental Protection Agency, if he believed climate change is a hoax like Trump has claimed.

“I believe that climate change is real,” Zeldin said. “As far as President Trump goes, the context that I've heard him speak about it, was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change, and I think that he's concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there's a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.”

Sanders said he disagreed with Zeldin’s characterization of Trump’s position on climate change.
Zeldin is a former congressman from New York. He left Congress in January 2023 and was among the Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted against certifying the 2020 election results. In his time in the House, he did not serve on committees that oversaw environmental policy.

2fb46lmUWeg,Industries to lead India's climate action | WION Climate Tracker | Latest News,"India will set carbon emission reduction targets for four fossil fuel-dependent sectors. The latest development comes at a time when the Asian country looks to align its industry with the country's greenhouse emissions reduction target. According to a Reuters report, India will fix carbon emission intensity benchmarks and reduction targets for three years for companies in petrochemicals, iron & steel, cement, and pulp & paper. The companies in the four sectors are also likely to be the first ones to trade on the country's carbon trading market from April 2025, which will enable them to buy and sell carbon credits to meet their goals.

This year’s wildfires in Los Angeles are apocalyptic—skies glow orange, ash rains down, and evacuations reach tens of thousands. Simultaneously, rare snowstorms grip the Gulf Coast, shattering century-old records and paralyzing a region unprepared for winter. Amid these crises, former President Donald Trump criticises climate policies, pulls out of climate deals and calls climate change ""a hoax"".  As fire and ice clash, Is America prepared to deal with climate extremes, with a president who doesn't want to listen?

M-UXXPqHGvE,Drastic Measures to Slow Global Warming,"Even if every country reaches the net zero targets committed to in the Paris Agreement, we’re still on track for several decades of warming. In this segment from Getting Warmer, Kal Penn familiarizes us with some of the more drastic proposals to fight the crisis, proposed by people less optimistic than him. 

---
Getting Warmer is Bloomberg's exclusive new show about climate, clean energy and business, anchored by actor and former White House aide Kal Penn.

Accompany him on his journey as he takes an up-close look at bold climate solutions and discovers new facets of the global transition to clean energy.

In a hosted studio segment, Penn sifts through the overwhelming news about our climate and breaks down the facts and trends to understand with a dose of humor and optimism. Why are the recycling symbols on your plastic cups misleading? How does the carbon credit market work and does it actually help? And what is the future of water in a drought-ridden world?

On the road, Penn meets the innovators, researchers, communities and businesses pivoting to new energy sources and spearheading low-carbon technologies. In documentary segments, Penn speaks to the self-declared “crypto cowboys” of Texas who claim Bitcoin mining can help stabilize the state’s troubled electrical grid, and travels to Nevada to visit the company attempting to build America’s first closed-loop supply chain for electric vehicles. In New York, Penn explores the urban designs proposed to save the city from the next Superstorm Sandy and goes inside New York’s Empire State building to investigate the challenges of decarbonizing our cities and landmarks. 

The show builds on, and includes contributions from, Bloomberg Green’s award-winning team of climate journalists as well as London-based climate storytellers Jack Harries and Alice Aedy. With a focus on the most pressing questions for young viewers, Jack and Alice unpack one big idea each episode. From recycled wastewater to regenerative agriculture and the challenges of a just transition for workers in the energy sector, they’ll break down how countries across the world are finding intriguing solutions to our climate crisis, and outline the challenges ahead.

Watch Getting Warmer starting February 1st at 8p EST streaming on Bloomberg channels on Connected TV Devices including Samsung TV+, LG Channels, and Fire TV. And on & Bloomberg.com.

You can also watch on Bloomberg TV (BTV)  at 10p ET.

The planet is not collapsing — you are.
You are not watching climate change; you are living it — as it.
Climate change is not a natural disaster. It’s a human reflection.
It’s not the forests that are burning — it’s your conscience.
You don’t protect the planet. You protect your self-image.
When your choices are rotten, how can the air be pure?
You ask when the world will end — but look in the mirror, it already has.
You are not on the Earth. You are the Earth.
Pollution doesn’t begin in the factories. It begins in desire.
The environment is not out there. It’s what you breathe, eat, and believe.

The motion was defeated.

ABOUT THE OXFORD UNION SOCIETY: The Oxford Union is the world's most prestigious debating society, with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford. Since 1823, the Union has been promoting debate and discussion not just in Oxford University, but across the globe.

The Oxford Union is deeply grateful and encouraged by the messages of support in response to our determination to uphold free speech. During our 200 year history, many have tried to shut us down. As the effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media and the arts show no signs of dissipating, the importance of upholding free speech remains as critical today as it did when we were founded in 1823. Your support is critical in enabling The Oxford Union to continue its mission without interruption and without interference.

1 - He creates an Applet that sends him inspiration for vegan recipes in a rich notification to help him limit the amount of meat he's eating and limit his carbon footprint. 
Applet: https://ifttt.com/applets/B2xrzB5p

2 - Every time Andy leaves home, he uses a geofence to make sure to turn off the lights by connecting IFTTT to his LIFX light. Simply turning off the lights can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 0.15 pounds per hour.
Applet: https://ifttt.com/applets/KmyGWHuQ

3 - He automates his email to send messages to his government representatives in Parliament. Being politically active by advocating for the environment enables Andy to make a greater impact.

AlFKMIfqaPE,The Scope of the Climate Crisis - [ECO]NOMICS Part 1,"Climate change is already here, and we are on a path towards catastrophic global warming. Governments have failed to curb carbon emissions, and fossil fuel production continues to increase.  This is not merely a political failure; it is also a failure of economic analysis.  

In this first lecture, Professor Juliet Schor (@bostoncollege) reviews the way economists have approached the problem of climate change. Conventional economists have misunderstood the problem and misdirected their attentions, producing policy recommendations that are not up to the challenge.  Many economists have focused on technological innovation, believing it sufficient.  Others have misdiagnosed it as a failure of government policy coordination, concluding it is an insurmountable political problem rather than an economic one. They overlook that climate destabilization has structurally inequitable causes and impacts.  Economists have tended to analyze it as a market failure and their recommendations over-rely on market mechanisms of dubious effectiveness to correct it. Still others have taken out inadequate cost-benefit analysis toolkits to construct overly optimistic estimates of the impact of climate disruption on the economy.  Economists have been central to the failure to respond to the crisis, and their approach has undermined action.

The UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom is a crucial opportunity to achieve pivotal, transformational change in global climate policy and action. It is a credibility test for global efforts to address climate change and it is where Parties must make considerable progress to reach consensus on issues they have been discussing for several years. COP 26 comes against the background of widespread, rapid and intensifying climate change impacts, which are already impacting every region on Earth. Also, COP 26 comes against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the urgent need to build back better for present future generations to ensure a safe future.

The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.

There is still time to tackle climate change, but it will require an unprecedented effort from all sectors of society. To boost ambition and accelerate actions to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, UN Secretary-General António Guterres is asking leaders, from government, business and civil society, to come to the 2019 Climate Action Summit on 23 September with plans to address the global climate emergency. The Summit will spark the transformation that is urgently needed and propel action that will benefit everyone.

——————-
Secretary-General António Guterres had warned world leaders not to come to his landmark Climate Action Summit with “platitudes”, but to present concrete plans for cutting harmful greenhouse gas emissions, and strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050. At the closing of the summit today (23 Sep), he thanked them “for delivering.”

Guterres also thanked young people “for leading the charge and holding my generation accountable.” He said, “we have been losing the fight against climate crises, but the world is waking up. Pressure is building, momentum is growing, and action by action the tide is turning.”

He said, “77 countries, many in the industrialized world, committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. They were joined by ten regions and more than 100 cities, including several of the world’s largest. 70 countries announced they will boost their National Determined Contributions by 2020. Well over 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating their move into the green economy.”

87 major companies - with a combined market capitalization of over US$2.3 trillion, over 4.2 million employees, and annual direct emissions equivalent to 73 coal-fired power plants - committed to setting climate targets across their operations.

These businesses include well-known brands such as Burberry, Danone, Ericsson, Electrolux, IKEA, and Nestlé. A number of these companies went a step further, by committing to “science-based targets”, which means that their corporate emissions cuts can be independently assessed.

In the finance sector, some of the world’s largest pension funds and insurers, responsible for directing more than $2 trillion in investments, have joined together to form the Asset Owner Alliance, which committed to moving their portfolios to carbon-neutral investments by 2050. The members of the Alliance are already engaging with companies in which they are investing, to ensure that they are decarbonizing their business models.

The Secretary-General, nevertheless, said “much more is still needed to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century.”

He said, “we need more concrete plans, more ambition from more countries and more businesses. And we need all financial institutions, public and private, to choose once and for all the green economy. And we need to see much more progress on carbon pricing and ending coal and other fossil fuel subsidies in the months to come.”

Among other initiatives, a total of 2000 cities committed to placing climate risk at the centre of their decision-making, planning and investments: this includes launching 1,000 bankable, climate-smart urban projects, and creating innovative financing mechanisms.",2019-09-23T23:34:02Z,UC5O114-PQNYkurlTg6hekZw,United Nations,"['UN', 'United Nations']",16614,255,17,PT4H12M40S,25,none,3100000,18742,456819284

Everyone’s talking about climate change.
But what is our climate? And why is it changing?
Our climate is the earth’s normal weather, over a very long time.
It usually takes hundreds, or thousands of years for the climate to change.
But recently, our climate has been changing much faster.
All these changes make life harder for our plants, animals, and for people around the world.
And the biggest cause of climate change, is humans. Including you and me.
When we use fuel, like oil and gasoline, or remove forests to make room for cities or farms, we release greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.
These greenhouse gasses cause our climate to get warmer.
Normally, when the heat from the sun warms our planet, some of the heat reflects back into space. But greenhouse gases act like a big blanket, holding some of it in.
This extra heat can cause all sorts of problems for our planet;and the plants, animals and people who live here.
Our ice and snow is melting faster.
Our oceans are getting warmer, and higher.
And our weather is becoming more extreme; with more heat waves, heavy rainfalls and powerful hurricanes.
Luckily, many countries around the world are working together to fight climate change.
And there are lots easy ways you and I can help too.
Like reusing things, instead of throwing them out; instead of driving, ride your bike or take the bus; use less electricity; and eat food grown closer to home.
You and I - we can make a difference.
We can fight climate change.",2021-03-04T19:04:22Z,UCdPRKH8tJ1VTsTdDc8c8fGg,Environment and Climate Change Canada,"['climate change', 'climate', 'environment', 'environment canada', 'what is climate change', 'how climate change works']",542931,5458,0,PT1M53S,28,none,9930,189,4510140

kbtZaqWVUgA,Russia Is Profiting Off Global Warming | VICE on HBO,"While many parts of the world are struggling from catastrophic effects of climate change, Russia is looking to capitalize on it, with the Kremlin driving a narrative that touts the economic benefits.

Like more and faster access to petroleum and mineral reserves that were previously unreachable. The Northern Sea Passage, a legendary shipping lane along Russia’s Arctic coastline, has been largely inaccessible for part of the year because of dense sea ice. But now, that ice is melting, opening up a new trade route for Russia's cargo ships. Russian oil companies are already betting big on the new reserves they hope to find in the Russian Arctic, and other industries — like mining — are ramping up production since they now have faster shipping routes to many ports.

“The problem of climate change is actually the problem of adaptation to climate change. This is not a tragedy,” said Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Oleg Anisimov. “Certainly some places will become unlivable, but other areas are places that will become more livable.”

But the Russian people seem unaware, or unconcerned, about the environmental impacts of these climate change-related activities, like pollution from the booming factories, and wildfires in the North that destroyed million of acres of forest in a major tourism area.

VICE’s Gianna Toboni visited Russia's Arctic to see just how big the country is betting on climate change.

qySBQjSXbfw,Wind and climate change | DW Documentary,"Shifting wind patterns are making extreme weather events more likely. This is because the wind, which distributes areas of high and low pressure along the latitude lines of the Earth, is also being influenced by climate change.

The wind is the motor for our weather. It brings us both sunshine and rain. And during the winter months, it regularly blows itself up into heavy storms. But throughout the globe, climate change is causing shifts in existing wind systems - with devastating consequences. Atlantic hurricanes, which build up over the tropics and often lay waste to swathes of land on the eastern coast of the US, are becoming more intense and bringing heavier rainfall.

Scientists are looking for clues as to the precise causes for the warming in the Arctic, where temperatures are climbing more rapidly than anywhere else in the world. In the northern hemisphere, rising temperatures result in wind systems ‘twisting’ at 10-kilometer altitudes. The Arctic jet stream drives high- and low-pressure areas around the globe. It travels around the planet from west to east at speeds of up to 500 kilometers an hour. But in recent years, meteorologists have noticed more frequent weaker phases in the jet stream - with fatal consequences for Europe. Droughts like the one experienced in 2018 and flood catastrophes like that of 2021 are both likely to recur.

Researchers on the island of Spitsbergen have already made an alarming discovery. Climate change is altering the wind, and the altered wind is accelerating climate change - a dangerous vicious cycle.

Apologies: I misread William Happer's name as Happner several times. Sorry about that 😬 There's a red arrow at around 05:00 which makes no particular sense, it should point to the entire carbon dioxide row. 

Many viewers have asked for a review of a recent study which supposedly shows “new evidence” in the climate change “debate.” More specifically, the study’s authors claim that we need to conduct more research into whether or not carbon dioxide emissions really cause climate change. I’ve had a look.

For centuries, Earth has witnessed climate shifts due to solar activity, volcanic eruptions, and ocean currents. Yet, post-industrial revolution, the rise in Earth's average temperature suggests an alarming trend. Human-driven activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, release greenhouse gases, intensifying global warming at an unprecedented rate. Scientists sound the alarm on the potential severe repercussions: rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disrupted ecosystems. While natural processes play a role in climate variability, the clear consensus underscores the human-centric nature of recent warming trends.... \n",2025-04-13T22:00:35Z,UC3JcE6L4B1HllEviRtlSmaQ,Conspiracy Talk,"['#climate-change', '#global-warming', '#human-impact', '#natural-cycles']",267,5,0,PT58S,24,none,30,69,9865

Recap 2024: When breaking heat records became an almost monthly affair
Earth is heating up at an unprecedented level and is slipping into an unchartered path.

With the threat of extinction of species running at an all time high, 2024 has witnessed vigorous reporting on issues pertaining to wildlife and biodiversity.

Threats of a new global pandemic become more realistic with climate change. There are now greater chances of emergence of new diseases as pathogens hidden beneath ice for centuries are uncovered and inter-species interactions grow with rapid land-use change.

In this inspiring and essential talk, Gore shares examples of extreme climate events (think: fires, floods and atmospheric tsunamis), identifies the man-made systems holding us back from progress and invites us all to join the movement for climate justice: ""the biggest emergent social movement in all of history,"" as he puts it.  An unmissable tour de force on the current state of the crisis --  and the transformations that will make it possible to find a way out of it.

Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world. Get involved at https://countdown.ted.com/sign-up

Abstract:
Depending on energy sources and demand, the carbon intensity of the public power grid fluctuates over time. Exploiting this variability is an important factor in reducing the emissions caused by data centers. However, regional differences in the availability of low- carbon energy sources make it hard to provide general best practices for when to consume electricity. Moreover, existing research in this domain focuses mostly on carbon-aware workload migration across geo-distributed data centers, or addresses demand response purely from the perspective of power grid stability and costs. In this paper, we examine the potential impact of shifting computational workloads towards times where the energy supply is expected to be less carbon-intensive. To this end, we identify characteristics of delay-tolerant workloads and analyze the potential for temporal workload shifting in Germany, Great Britain, France, and California over the year 2020. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate two workload shifting scenarios in a simulation to investigate the influence of time constraints, scheduling strategies, and the accuracy of carbon intensity forecasts. To accelerate research in the domain of carbon-aware computing and to support the evaluation of novel scheduling algorithms, our simulation framework and datasets are publicly available.

You’ve seen it in the comment section before: “Climate change is natural. It’s happened before and it will keep happening”. In reality, comments like these are the newest kind of climate change denial. In this video we’re going to learn about all the reasons that Earth’s climate changes, natural and otherwise, and then how we know that modern climate change can’t be blamed on natural forces. Maybe we can finally put this biggest myth about climate change in the trash.

Unexpected not because he supports action on climate change -- we've known this for a long time -- but because he claimed that rising carbon dioxide levels will make it uncomfortable to breathe, and give us headaches and nausea.

'Trees for the Future' estimates that agroforestry trees, planted in tropical climates, will sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide at an average of 22.6 kg (50 pounds) of carbon dioxide per tree per year. 
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090218135031.htm

Even planting a trillion new trees would capture only 6% of carbon by 2050 and will stave off only 0.15 degrees Celsius by 2100. 
https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/bill-gates-is-not-entirely-wrong-about-trees-he-s-not-entirely-right-either-92151

By far the biggest ultimate impact is having one fewer child, which the researchers calculated equated to a reduction of 58 tonnes of CO2 for each year of a parent’s life.
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children

Over 20 years, a beech tree could store about 317.8 kg of CO2.
However, having one fewer child can significantly reduce a family's carbon footprint, approximately 58,600 kg of CO2-equivalent per year.
This means one saves 11,72,000 kg of CO2e in 20 years by having one fewer child.
Having one less child is equal to planting and maintaining 3500 beech trees!

Beef, soy, and palm oil are responsible for 60% of tropical deforestation.
More than 77% of global soy is fed to livestock for meat and dairy production. Just 7% of soy is used directly for human food products such as tofu, soy milk, edamame beans, and tempeh.

In India, EVs are estimated to emit 15-40% less CO2 compared to petrol vehicles across their lifecycle.

The anthropocentric worldview sees humans as separate from and superior to nature, viewing other entities as resources to be exploited for human benefit.
The Judeo-Christian creation story in Genesis has been interpreted by some as giving humans dominion over nature and other living creatures.
Some Western philosophers like Aristotle and Kant have been associated with anthropocentric views that place humans as superior to nature.

Climate change is happening now, and even world leaders meeting for climate talks at this year’s Cop25 know we aren’t doing enough to stop it.
In fact, we’re going backwards. The UN says carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are going up, and the earth is on track to warm by 3.2 degrees before the century is over. The consequences of that acceleration are already proving disastrous for communities around the world.
This week’s episode of Start Here cuts through the science and the politics, to get you what you need to know about what’s at stake for the planet.

With rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, and changing landscapes, successfully adapting to climate change is increasingly important. For humans, this can mean using technology to find solutions. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these changes involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Erin Eastwood explains how animals are adapting to climate change.

0WQCGvNp2K4,The biggest problem with Climate Change | Konstantin Kisin,"John and Konstantin discuss the lies that are being told about how best to combat climate change and what the consequences of those lies are.

Raised in the Soviet Union, Konstantin is not persuaded by leftist visions of utopia, and exhorts reasonable people to speak out against the 'woke mob'. He also argues that multiculturalism should be rebranded as multi-ethnic societies with a 'monoculture', uniting everyone from different backgrounds.

Konstantin Kisin is a writer, social commentator, comedian, and co-host of the free speech podcast Triggernometry. He is a regular on British and American TV and radio shows including Question Time, Good Morning Britain, BBC Breakfast, Daily Politics, LBC Cross Question, Tucker Carlson, the Megyn Kelly Show, and many others. 

Konstantin has written for publications including the Daily Telegraph, the Spectator, Tablet Magazine, Quillette, and Standpoint as well as his first book, An Immigrant’s Love Letter to the West. More recently, he spoke at the inaugural Alliance for Responsible Citizenship Conference in London, England. 

Conversations feature John Anderson, former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, interviewing the world's foremost thought leaders about today's pressing social, cultural and political issues.

John believes proper, robust dialogue is necessary if we are to maintain our social strength and cohesion. As he puts it; ""You cannot get good public policy out of a bad public debate.""

The global average ocean temperature hit an all time high in April, and continues to break records almost daily. One of the impacts of warming oceans is the harm caused to marine ecosystems.
We're seeing coral reefs bleach and die, and mass fish die-offs. Warmer oceans contribute to stronger storms, hurricanes, and cyclones, and facilitate more evaporation. And these extreme storms dump more rain - just look at the flooding that has occurred around the world in the last few days.

Mr Trump said he had heard former president Barack Obama spruik the numbers, but not Joe Biden “because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means"". 

The presidential candidates were asked how they would address climate change while supporting jobs growth. 

President Trump responded he removed the US from the Paris Accord because it was unfair and would have destroyed American business. 

“When they put us in there they did us a great disservice, they took away our business,” he said. 

“I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord.” 

In his response, Democratic nominee Joe Biden warned Americans climate change was “an existential threat to humanity”. 

“We have a moral obligation to deal with it and we‘re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time,” Mr Biden said. 

“We’re going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years.”

He said under his presidency, 50,000 charging stations would be installed on US highways “so that we can own the electric car market of the future”.",2020-10-23T03:08:14Z,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,Sky News Australia,"['world', 'msn', 'yt', 'fb', '6204057560001']",4708,203,80,PT8M14S,25,none,5480000,186023,6205475458

------------------------
Every person, in every country in every continent will be impacted in some shape or form by climate change. There is a climate cataclysm looming, and we are underprepared for what this could mean.

Climate change is caused by human activities and threatens life on earth as we know it. With rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated. Its impacts can be devastating and include extreme and changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.

If left unchecked, climate change will undo a lot of the development progress made over the past years. It will also provoke mass migrations that will lead to instability and wars.

To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre- industrial levels, emissions must already be decreasing and need to be cut by almost half by 2030, just seven years away. But, we are drastically off track from this target.

Urgent and transformative going beyond mere plans and promises are crucial. It requires raising ambition, covering entire economies and moving towards climate-resilient development, while outlining a clear path to achieve net-zero emissions. Immediate measures are necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.",2024-05-22T15:33:31Z,UC5O114-PQNYkurlTg6hekZw,United Nations,"['sustainable development goals', 'united nations', 'climate change', 'naciones unidas', 'nations unies', 'human rights', 'sustainable development goals explained']",2370,102,7,PT6S,25,none,3100000,18742,456819284

hsoeGqEgJ9U,Velshi: The climate crisis is here,"So far this summer, wildfire smoke has choked cities across the country week after week. Multiple heatwaves are gripping massive swaths of the nation, with no end in sight. The global temperature record broke at least three times in a row last week, and this next week may be even hotter. Models from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimate that 20% of Americans in the contiguous U.S. will experience dangerous temperatures this week. We are now experiencing some of the impacts of climate change - and it’s not going to stop until we curb emissions. So now, it’s imperative that at the local, state, and federal level, we learn how to protect ourselves.

-wJo5aKBwq0,Climate Action Tracker: The state of the climate crisis in 2021 | TED,"Take action on climate change at http://countdown.ted.com.

2021 is a critical year for climate change. According to the Paris Climate Agreement, governments must decide now on how to reduce the amount of carbon they pump into the atmosphere in order to avoid the most devastating consequences of global warming. So, are we on track to limit global warming to only 1.5 degrees Celsius? The Climate Action Tracker explains the good news and the bad news for the planet. (Updated June 2021)

This talk was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020. (Watch the full event here: https://youtu.be/5dVcn8NjbwY.) Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world. Get involved at https://countdown.ted.com/sign-up

CBl-HncKC5c,Carbon emissions and surface warming,"This animation forms part of the series “Carbon and Climate”, which is an ideal introduction to how carbon dioxide and the climate interact, and is intended for school children, teachers and interested members of the general public. Scientists predict the rise in global temperatures from carbon dioxide emissions by using computer models. The video considers how different models give slightly different predictions but shows how there is a clear and simple relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and the warming of Earth: the climate change message is simple, the more carbon we emit, the warmer our climate will become.

The simple equation linking warming and carbon emission developed by Phil Goodwin and Ric Williams in https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2304 

We are very grateful to the actor James Cartwright - The Archers, Downton Abbey (film), Johnny Shakespeare - for voicing all three videos in the series.

This video was made by Ocean and Climate scientists and colleagues at the University of Liverpool’s School of Environmental Sciences.

Animation, Direction and Production: Andy Heath
Narration: James Cartwright
Visual Artist: Chris Murray
Script and Principle Investigator: Ric Williams
Co Investigator: Phil Goodwin

Oceanographic research in Liverpool and the surrounding area dates back to the year 1764 when William Hutchinson began taking twice daily sea level measurements, which continued for 30 years. His records are still being used in scientific research. In 2020, Liverpool celebrates 100 years of teaching Ocean Sciences. Interested in joining us? Find our list of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Ocean and Climate Sciences, including Marine Biology, Geography and Mathematics at https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences

Other parts of the “Carbon and Climate” series address what happens to the carbon dioxide we emit, how the emitted carbon dioxide changes how the surface of Earth warms, and various potential warming scenarios that depend on what action we take. Or do not take.

The simple equation linking warming and carbon emission developed by Phil Goodwin and Ric Williams is reported in https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2304. We have used this equation:

(i) to estimate how much carbon may be emitted before reaching the Paris climate agreement https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-017-0054-8

(ii) explain differences in the response of climate models over the next century

But, in fact, to stop the climate crisis, we first have to dismantle the systems of oppression that caused it. Jamie Margolin is an activist, student, author, and co-founder of the youth climate justice movement Zero Hour, which mobilizes young people all over the world for emergency climate action. Her activism is rooted in her love of both the American Pacific Northwest, where she grew up, and the wilderness of her mother's home country, Colombia, both of which are deteriorating due to human causes. Her identity as a queer, Jewish, Latina motivates her to fight for the marginalized and get to the root of the problems that hold down our world.

C-TRNFQ8Gdc,Global Warming - Gojira - Guitar Cover and Tab [Instrumental] [100th Cover!],"A much requested song for my 100th cover! Global Warming by Gojira 🤘

Tuning - D Standard

NB - the bass cover will be up later this week/next week

Taken from the album 'From Mars to Sirius' this is a challenging song on a structural level and on a stamina level. There's only 3 main ideas - the intro, the main riff, the chorus, but the constant alterations on the main riff make it hard to remember and a challenge to learn and it's clear why Gojira choose not to play it live apart from the one studio video.

Questions and comments below!

20 years of UN climate negotiations have failed to produce a binding and universal agreement for climate change action. This is the last chance for world leaders to change course and ensure a sustainable future for all.

One Young World Counsellors including former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Unilever CEO Paul Polman and philanthropist Sir Bob Geldof also called on world leaders to commit to urgent climate action.

Call On COP messages are being broadcast by media outlets around the world. Spread the #CallOnCOP message to ensure that world leaders are held to account for the decisions that define our future.

He tells BC Today host Michelle Eliot it's crucial to take any action against climate change now to limit the scale of the damage, especially in the face of misinformation and hostile dialogue about the environment.

L_ctzRDJ7R8,Closing the Loop on Carbon Emissions | Twelve,"Twelves’ “carbon transformation” fundamentally changes this paradigm by sourcing carbon from CO2 instead of fossil fuels. By replacing the fossil carbon in critical chemicals with renewable, recycled carbon from CO2, we can eliminate emissions from thousands of essential products and set a new standard for how things get made in the climate era.

O8duvJfrjss,How Is Your City Tackling the Climate Crisis? | Marvin Rees | TED,"""If we can unlock the full potential of our cities, we can minimize the price the planet pays for hosting us in our growing numbers,"" says Marvin Rees, the Mayor of Bristol, UK, who understands deeply how cities can help (or hurt) the environment. Rees notes that while sustainable infrastructure already exists in many parts of the world -- like electric buses in Colombia and freshwater reserves in Singapore -- major investments could make similar innovations more far-reaching and successful. He highlights the pivotal role of city mayors in advocating for a ""worldwide network of efficient decarbonized cities"" that will bring the world closer to its climate goals.

More on the debate: The Democratic presidential candidates have concluded the first 2020 debate emphasizing the promise of America.

The 10 candidates ended the night Wednesday by boiling down their stump speeches into answers that included why they were best positioned to beat President Donald Trump and how the primary is a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party.

Fighting poverty, combating climate change and the proper role of government were prominent features of the concluding comments of the first debate of the 2020 cycle.

Thursday will be the second night of debates. It, too, will feature 10 candidates, including front-runners former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will also appear.

X11xoGeX0s8,Why Tracking Carbon Emissions Is Suddenly A Billion Dollar Opportunity,"As extreme weather events roiled communities around the world this summer, businesses and governments are feeling more pressure than ever to respond to climate change.

Tracking emissions has historically been difficult, because the methods for tracking a company’s carbon footprint are all over the place. In the U.S., corporate sustainability reporting remains unstandardized and largely voluntary. But the landscape looks better in Europe, as a recently adopted proposal is set to expand the number of companies that must produce sustainability reports. That measure will also require more detailed and standardized disclosures and impose mandatory audits.

That’s where companies like Plan A and Planetly come in. These Berlin-based startups make software that helps companies monitor, report and reduce their carbon emissions, and the market for their services is booming. Meanwhile, apps like Klima, which help individuals offset their own personal emissions, are also growing rapidly.

QjJl0GFzRBs,Climate Change Series – 3. Evidence of Climate Change,"#climatechange #ngscience #earthday 
https://ngscience.com
Evidence of Climate Change:
While some individuals may question whether human activities are responsible for climate change, the vast majority of scientific evidence paints an irrefutable picture: our actions are driving significant and accelerated changes in our planet's climate. The following signs and symptoms of climate change are a testament to the magnitude of this global challenge.

Rising Global Temperatures: Not Just a Hot Day!

Global temperatures are on an upward trend. This isn't just about experiencing a hotter summer day; it's about consistent patterns showing that average temperatures across the planet are increasing. These warmer conditions contribute to many of the other changes we're seeing in our climate.

Melting Glaciers and Polar Ice:

Our polar regions are like the Earth's air conditioners, but they're currently under threat. The ice in these regions, from expansive glaciers to vast ice sheets, is melting at an alarming rate. As these icy giants melt, they not only cause sea levels to rise but also reduce the reflective white surfaces that help bounce some of the sun's rays back into space.

Rising Sea Levels: Why Coastal Cities are at Risk

The melting ice from polar regions, combined with the expansion of seawater as it warms, leads to rising sea levels. This isn't just a slight increase. It poses significant threats to coastal cities, which can experience increased flooding, erosion, and even the potential of being submerged in the future.

More Frequent Extreme Weather Events

With the world heating up, our weather systems are becoming more unpredictable and intense. This means more frequent and severe heatwaves, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, and heavy rainfall events. These extreme conditions can lead to a range of challenges, from water shortages to devastating property damage and loss of life.

The evidence is clear: our planet is undergoing rapid and profound changes. Recognizing these signs is the first step in understanding the broader implications and preparing for the future.",2023-09-05T02:47:28Z,UC5g3t_XWCC2jNLFA1POenCw,Next Generation Science,"['Carbon', 'Greenhouse', 'Emissions', 'Warming', 'Glaciers', 'Methane', 'Ozone', 'Deforestation', 'Sea-level', 'Temperature', 'Mitigation', 'Adaptation', 'Extinction', 'Drought', 'CO2', 'Albedo', 'Icecaps', 'Feedback', 'Radiative', 'Atmosphere', 'Renewable', 'Biodiversity', 'Permafrost', 'Sink', 'Ocean-acidification', 'Cyclones', 'ngscience', 'ngscience.com', 'next generation', 'science', 'scientific', 'demonstration', 'kids', 'children', 'students', 'school', 'teacher', 'resource', 'elementary', 'primary', 'educational', 'learning', 'instructional', 'informative', 'classroom']",5648,37,0,PT2M50S,27,none,179000,629,24964094

Earth’s climate is changing in a big way, and it’s because there's more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any point in our species’ history. But Earth’s climate has changed before. How do we know that this time we’re the cause? We know thanks to tiny bubbles of ancient atmosphere trapped in ice. #climatechange #globalwarming

0hMmvRDQiCQ,This 14-Year-Old Climate Activist Is Giving Up School to Save the World,"Alexandria Villaseñor is standing in front of the U.S. Capitol and posting Instagram stories like any other teenager.

“Is there any good music that goes with climate action?” the 14-year-old asks a group of activists.

A couple of suggestions later, a song that’s more than twice her age blasts from her phone speakers on abbreviated loop: “It’s the end of the world as we know it… It’s the end of the world as we know it…” 

And Alexandria doesn’t feel fine. Over the next few hours, she’ll have meetings with both of New York’s senators to ask them to do what they can to ensure her generation doesn’t experience the actual end of the world because of climate change.

“I notice a lot of politicians are looking at what is politically possible,” she told VICE News in an interview. “But I did think with some politicians I talk to that we're on the same page on how urgent this is.”

Around the globe, young people like Alexandria see the climate crisis as the existential threat to their generation. They’ve skipped school in more than 130 countries to demand policy changes, following the lead of Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old from Sweden who is currently sailing across the Atlantic Ocean to attend the United Nations climate talks in September. 

As one of the movement’s American organizers, Alexandria has also become a prominent young critic of world leaders’ inaction. Even though nearly 200 countries pledged in the Paris Agreement to keep global temperatures from hitting catastrophic levels, laws and norms aren’t changing quickly enough, and global greenhouse gas emissions are still going up.

When her classmates go back to middle school this fall, Alexandria won’t be joining them. Instead, she’ll take on eighth grade via independent study so that she can lead her global youth network, Earth Uprising, and continue her activism at full blast.

Our planet is getting hotter. Since the Industrial Revolution—an event that spurred the use of fossil fuels in everything from power plants to transportation—Earth has warmed by 1 degree Celsius, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. 

That may sound insignificant, but 2023 was the hottest year on record, and all 10 of the hottest years on record have occurred in the past decade. A reconstruction of Earth's average temperature over the past 485 million years showed that when the planet warms, catastrophic weather and mass extinctions follow. At no point in the period of Earth's history examined, the study notes, have temperatures warmed as quickly as they're warming now.

Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems.",2024-10-27T14:22:42Z,UCC1RO8lWXXPZwc34sl6125g,Historic Hindi,"['global warming in hindi', 'global warming documentary in hindi', 'climate change in hindi', 'geography', 'earth facts']",20478,650,31,PT6M52S,27,none,3030000,578,282720345

We drive around in cars instead of riding  horses, use air conditioners instead of fans, and use refrigerators instead of harvesting  ice. However, because of these and other human activities, temperatures on the Earth  are rising, and the ozone layer that has protected us is being destroyed. Today’s topic is ‘ Global Warming and the Ozone Layer.’

Das wollen wir ändern: In unserem neuen Podcast “Climate Action – Child Protection” gehen wir den Aspekten der Klimakrise auf den Grund, die man vielleicht nicht immer auf dem Schirm hat. Vor allem aber wollen wir zeigen, dass Kinder und Jugendliche nicht nur Opfer dieser globalen Krise sind, sondern ihre Stärke und ihren Mut in den Vordergrund stellen. 

In der ersten Folge sprechen wir mit der philippinischen Klimaaktivistin Marinel Ubaldo, die als Kind den Supertaifun Haiyan überlebte. Sie berichtet, warum sie Teil der Lösung sein will und wie sie mit ihrer Wut auf das Versagen in der Klimapolitik umgeht. Außerdem verrät sie, was sie und andere junge Menschen brauchen, die im Klimaschutz tätig sind. Der Podcast ist auf Englisch, weil wir so möglichst viele Menschen auf der Welt erreichen wollen, die mit den SOS-Kinderdörfern zu tun haben.

NjrnJG4Y-TY,Greta and eight young activists on climate crisis PLUS more from Greta's world debut at COP-24,"Greta who we introduced at the UNFCCC's COP-24 in Poland, at the young age of 16, has become a world leader of immense proportions.  Here she is one of 8 young people participating in a thought-provoking video composed by UNICEF, to whom we also owe our gratitude in allowing us to re-post their work.

May we all learn the lessons these young people are teaching and take the climate crisis much more seriously than we have.  We are sacrificing our children's world forever for the sake of profits to an economic system that is blinded by Money to the sacrifice that is being made.

We've added an excerpt from another youth program from our COP-24 programs with both a link to view the entire video, and the entire COP-24 playlist where Greta made her debut on the world stage.  Here's a link to the full video from the 'teaser' at the end of this one...

This program will train over 100 students in making materials and manufacturing processes cleaner through technological innovation and entrepreneurship, and help Canada reach net zero carbon emissions.

Students will gain specific training in: 
1) research to support the industrial transition to net zero 
2) tools for assessing the total life cycle potential of specific technologies and 
3) entrepreneurial skills that can accelerate the transition of product to market. 

These will be combined with professional skills training in communication, program management and mentorship. Trainees will also gain an understanding of climate justice, recognizing that transitioning to net zero risks creating or amplifying economic and social disparities. Combined, these provide an internationally unique training program.

jAa58N4Jlos,Climate Change - A Short Film [4K],"Original Video by Philip Kapadia: https://youtu.be/DhhVr5iLF-c

The challenge facing our climate is the greatest existential threat of our lifetime. The actions will take now will determine the future for generations to come. Now is not a time for half measures nor is it a time where we can we afford to continue our prioritization of profit over people. Climate change is greater than any one of us, but it requires every single one of us to come together to ensure there can and will be a future for the next to come.

This isn't a problem half measures can solve. It goes beyond energy efficiency and zero net emissions. We need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere -- and do so within the next ten years or else we face irreparable damage to our atmosphere. The implications are huge-- mass disease caused by carbon pollution, rising sea levels, extinction, shortages of every major resource, migration inland. The cost of waiting far exceeds the price to act now. We need bold policies that put the life and continuity of humankind above profit.  

Make sure to like and share with everyone you know!
We need to spread these information, we need our society to wake up!

2MEdlgrPpR8,Reduce Carbon Emissions With Oilfield Electrification,"Oil and gas companies are electrifying assets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support ESG goals. Using an integrated EPC approach delivers fewer operational upsets, speed to market, and cost efficiency and savings. https://hubs.li/Q01gybwQ0 #OilfieldElectrification #OilfieldESG #OilfieldEPC

---

Simon Palacio:
The oil and gas industry has been one of the largest non-nation targets for activists seeking greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the world. Oil and gas is one of the biggest polluters in the world. So exploration and production companies have to maintain an ESG portfolio and show efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, just in order to have access to capital, to find new fields, drill new wells, and build their infrastructure. Greenhouse gas reductions is not just good for the environment. It's good business as well.

With mounting environmental pressures driven as a means of access to capital and pressures to reduce lease operating expenses, exploration and production companies have been pushed to electrify all of their assets at almost all pieces of oilfield equipment out there, whether it be pumps or drill rigs can be electrified. Oilfield electrification is the comprehensive process that includes everything from pre-capital consulting through commissioning and closeout. We're transitioning the power source of upstream oil and gas production assets, like your rigs and your drills from fossil fuels, which have been primarily gas and diesel to the electric grid, renewable power.

The ultimate goal of oilfield electrification is to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions in what has been a very traditionally fossil fuel equipment-driven process. Burns & McDonnell is the only EPC firm in the industry that's offering it as an all-inclusive program. This partnership is going to bring oil and gas companies, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, fewer operational upsets, speed to market, cost efficiency and savings, routine flaring reduction, and it's going to support ESG goals. We value a deep trust in our partnerships that has proven to deliver lasting results since 1898.",2022-07-11T19:36:17Z,UCBW9GgtvNdmW9A0apNTpiyA,Burns & McDonnell,[],607,14,0,PT2M6S,28,none,6920,254,953285

Countries have a 14% chance of keeping global warming below 1.5C even in the most optimistic scenario where all net-zero pledges are met, according to an analysis by the UN’s environment program. Current emissions-cutting plans put the world on course for up-to 2.9C of global warming and that’s assuming nations fulfill their unconditional commitments.

The findings come less than two weeks before the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, which has the key aim of laying out what countries need to do to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement in 2015, chiefly keeping warming below 2C, and ideally 1.5C. To do so, emissions need to fall by 28% to 42% by the end of the decade, compared with current policy scenarios, according to the UN’s report.

pEt6-jA2UE4,Climate change - Averting catastrophe | DW Documentary,"In the last 30 years, CO2 emissions have increased by 60 percent worldwide. The most pressing problem facing our civilization is global warming. What solutions could there be? This documentary accompanies activists in their efforts to combat climate change.

According to scientists, if by the year 2100 the global temperature has risen more than 1.5 degrees Celsius on levels recorded in the year 1850, the consequences could be devastating for people and the environment. But will we manage to achieve this ambitious goal? Around the world, politicians, companies, laboratories and universities are struggling to find solutions. 

The film team visits climate rescuers in Sudan, Indonesia and Europe. Their inventive spirit cools buildings, connects countries with green electricity lines or sucks carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Their work helps determine the living conditions of generations to come.

Every time the women of Shagra plant an acacia seedling in the sand of Darfur, it is an occasion of great joy in the Sudanese village. The tree will drive its roots 100 meters into the ground and be better able to withstand the droughts in the Sahel than most other plants. It will secrete gum sap when women scratch the bark after a few years. The sale of gum arabic will alleviate poverty in the village.

65,000 acacias are already growing in Darfur: a blessing for the bitterly poor region, as well as a carbon dioxide reservoir that can help limit global warming.

The new target comes ahead of a national commitment to stabilise emissions around 2030 under the Paris Agreement. The GreenGov.SG initiative will see sustainable practices expanded beyond government-owned offices to cover public institutions like healthcare and transport facilities. Public servants will be encouraged to adopt eco-friendly habits and start ground-up initiatives within their agencies. The public sector generates about 7% of Singapore's emissions.

Since it was originally published in 2021, this consolidated content will prime you for our upcoming interview with Paul Hawken. If you have specific questions you'd like me to ask Paul, please send me an email note to: hello@caremorebebetter.com (mailto:hello@caremorebebetter.com)  

Regeneration: Land, People, and Joining The Movement to Reverse Global Warming

LAND: The topics covered range from Regenerative Agriculture to Composting and Vermiculture, Degraded Land Restoration and Returning Biodiversity. It's a hopeful chapter on everything we can do to change our current trajectory, reverse global warming, and return health to our soil, to our people, and our planet. We can draw down carbon - put it back where it belongs, and continue forward, creating a better future. 

PEOPLE: With this chapter, we reveal and our role in solving the climate crisis, reversing global warming. We are asked to think about the role of colonialism in climate change, of its damaging effect on ecosystems as we knowingly or unknowingly eradicated the knowledge of generations who maintained forest farms and grasslands by pushing them off their homesteads. It’s a call to action for all of us. We are one, and it’s time we start acting like it.

A silent enemy is inflicting losses worth billions on India's economy. In 2022, India lost 8% of its GDP due to climate change. In a significant ruling, India's Supreme Court has delivered a landmark judgement pertaining to climate change. The top court has ruled that the right against climate change is a distinct fundamental right. This judgement comes as India combats extreme climatic conditions, with a severe heatwave sweeping across the nation. While the Apex court has asserted that the rights to life and equality are intricately linked to a stable environment, the challenges associated with climate change are bleeding India's economy. Palki Sharma explains the significance of this judgment.

Microbes could become key allies in global efforts to curb carbon emissions and avoid dangerous climate change. A group of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs consume CO2 through their natural metabolism, spitting out small organic molecules as a byproduct. These microbes could be enlisted to convert industrial CO2 emissions into valuable chemicals thanks to a new concept developed by Pascal Saikaly and his team at KAUST.

In US news and current events today, NowThis News is looking back on the biggest moments of the year in climate activism and the fight against climate change. This is how young climate crisis activists changed the world. One of the biggest moments of the year was when teen climate activist and Fridays for Future founder Greta Thunberg spoke at the United Nations. This became known as the Greta Thunberg How Dare You speech and launched many Greta Thunberg How Dare You memes and GIFs.

wuXURo0FUjM,The Solutions to the Climate Crisis No One is Talking About | Robert Reich,"Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich explains why we must not go back to normal after this coronavirus crisis ends, and breaks down four key steps we must take to prevent total climate catastrophe.

First, create green jobs. Investing in renewable energy could create millions of family sustaining, union jobs and build the infrastructure we need for marginalized communities to access clean water and air.

Second, stop dirty energy. A massive investment in renewable energy jobs isn’t enough to combat the climate crisis. If we are going to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we must tackle the problem at its source: Stop digging up and burning more oil, gas, and coal.

Third, kick fossil fuel companies out of our politics. For decades, companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP have been polluting our democracy by pouring billions of dollars into our politics and bankrolling elected officials to enact policies that protect their profits. The oil and gas industry spent over $103 million on the 2016 federal elections alone.

Fourth, require the fossil fuel companies that have profited from environmental injustice to compensate the communities they've harmed.
As if buying off our democracy wasn’t enough, these corporations have also deliberately misled the public for years on the amount of damage their products have been causing.

If these solutions sound drastic to you, it’s because they are. They have to be if we have any hope of keeping our planet habitable. The climate crisis is not a far-off apocalyptic nightmare — it is our present day.

Q-7WdngqAD4,Native Climate Action | Radar 2021,"One of the largest climate action summits, COP26, takes place during Native American Heritage month here in the US—a fitting time junction considering Native Americans, and indigenous peoples worldwide, are the least likely to contribute to climate change yet stand to be among the most directly impacted.

The close relationship native communities have to the environment is counterpart to their reliance of its natural resources, resources that are becoming scarce due to global inaction. And while world leaders endlessly debate which egregious practices to cut back on, native communities are taking more progressive actions via climate action plans rooted in sustainable environmental practices passed down from their ancestors over centuries.

These communities have long acknowledged that our actions in addressing natural or man-made environmental crises will have a lasting impact on future generations, and that we have a responsibility to be accountable for that impact. And given the EPA’s recent findings that US indigenous, Black and Latinx communities are bearing the brunt of the negative environmental devastation, their sense of urgency warranted.

While the Biden administration establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity—the first federal program focused specifically on how greenhouse gas emissions affect human health—is a step forward, taking a note from the commitment and strategic action of indigenous communities could offer some much-needed assistance in our pursuit of a more sustainable environment and populace for years to come.

All in all, when it comes to confronting climate change, the United States—and the world—can learn a lot from indigenous communities.

The affected areas have had only half the average rainfall this season, while the country has experienced more than double the number of fires this year than last. 

Woo-Kyun Lee, a climatic environment professor, said the rapid increase in temperatures, prolonged dryness and stronger winds had exacerbated the fires. 'For this reason, wildfires in our country are bound to become more frequent, spread on a larger scale,' he said

n9Ej5E47TNI,Europe’s climate in 2050,"The speed and magnitude of the climate change we are facing today is unprecedented. Heatwaves, droughts, floods... We are feeling its effects on our daily lives, year after year. Its impacts will increase at least until 2050 and every region of Europe will be affected.

Based on the results of the latest available studies, and in particular, on the 6th IPCC report, this film, produced by scientists in the framework of the European project EUCP, aims to present to the general public the climate changes expected in Europe in 2050. The researchers explain in an accessible way the variations in temperature and precipitation as well as the extreme climate events that European inhabitants will have to face.

This film provides the keys to understand how climate will reshape our landscapes and lifestyles over the coming decades. ... and to enable us to better anticipate the need for human societies to adapt to this partly inevitable climate change.

The climate crisis isn’t a distant threat. It’s been happening for decades in Sri Lanka. Let's uncover its impact in Sri Lanka on International Mother Earth Day.
According to the UN, floods, droughts, and several other climate-related disasters have affected millions of Sri Lankans. Many rely on industries deeply affected by environmental changes. Women who make up 80% of those most affected by climate change face additional challenges due to structural inequalities.
Moreover, due to climate change and the scarcity of resources, competition over water and land already sparked conflicts between farmers. Agriculture-reliant communities also have barriers to innovation due to high costs, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to knowledge.
Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2050, 19 million Sri Lankans will reside in areas classified as moderate or severe climate hotspots. 
A sustainable solution to climate challenges requires a collaborative approach where the government, civil society organizations (CSOs), and local communities work together. Stay tuned to learn more about building resilience towards climate change in Sri Lanka.
The video is produced as part of the Building Resilience project, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office through the British High Commission Colombo and implemented by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), #Chrysalis and Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA). The video contains clips from Swarnawahini, News 1st, Hiru TV, and Rupawahini, and was produced by Sharni Jayawardena.

QYG01wuN2bg,"Capture, utilize, store: harnessing carbon emissions with CCS","Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has an important role to play in the energy transition – especially in helping decarbonize traditional energy and industrial infrastructure. 

CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and then transporting these, either by ship or pipeline, to be stored underground. But how can this technology help address industrial emissions at scale? And can innovations such as digital twins help advance the CCS technology?

HOop9qYYXVg,What is Carbon footprint Environment studies hindi/urdu (on student demand),"What is Carbon footprint Environment studies Hindi/Urdu (on student demand)
When you drive a car, the engine burns fuel which creates a certain amount of CO2, depending on its fuel consumption and the driving distance. Even if you heat your house with electricity, the generation of the electrical power may also have emitted a certain amount of CO2. The production of the food and goods also emitted some quantities of CO2. Your carbon footprint is the sum of all emissions of CO2, which were induced by your activities in a given time frame.

Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide or CO2 into the earth's atmosphere.  In the year 2019  we were still pumping out  around 37 billion more.  That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes  of  other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we’re emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. 
And emissions keep rising – but they need to get down to 0!

The Costs of War project estimates the military produced around 1.2 billion metric tons of carbon emissions between 2001 and 2017, with nearly a third coming from U.S. wars overseas. But military carbon emissions have largely been exempted from international climate treaties dating back to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol after lobbying from the United States. We go to Glasgow to speak with Ramón Mejía, anti-militarism national organizer of Grassroots Global Justice Alliance and Iraq War veteran; Erik Edstrom, Afghanistan War veteran turned climate activist; and Neta Crawford, director of the Costs of War project. “The United States military has been a mechanism of environmental destruction,” says Crawford.

-Vm_gabtIA8,Which U.S. Cities Are Safest From Climate Change?,"Climate havens or climate destinations are cities that are situated in places that avoid the worst effects of natural disasters and have the infrastructure to support a larger population. Many of these legacy cities are in the U.S. Northeast. Watch the video to see where Americans can move to avoid the risk of wildfires and flooding from rising seal levels, and learn how these destination cities can translate climate migration into an economic triumph.

Millions of Americans are living in communities with precarious climate conditions, in houses that feel overpriced.

There is a solution for many of these people, though: Move to one of the so-called climate havens.

Climate havens or climate destinations are situated in places that avoid the worst effects of natural disasters and have the infrastructure to support a larger population. Many of these legacy cities are located in the Northeast.

Jesse Keenan, associate professor of real estate at Tulane University, named the following cities as possible climate havens:

Asheville, North Carolina
Buffalo, New York
Burlington, Vermont
Detroit, Michigan
Duluth, Minnesota
Madison, Wisconsin
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Rochester, New York

Anna Marandi, who served as the program manager of climate resilience and sustainability at the National League of Cities, added four other places to the safe haven list: Ann Arbor, Michigan; Charleston, South Carolina; Chico, California; and perhaps surprisingly, Orlando, Florida.

Orlando makes the cut, Marandi said, because the city has introduced measures to decarbonize. While the natural environment, such as being a noncoastal city, is an advantage, cities can “earn” the designation by working to provide benefits like affordable housing and being committed to economic sustainability.

“I see climate migration as an opportunity for these cities to avoid the mistakes of urban sprawl,” Marandi said. “They often have a vibrant, walkable downtown that might just need a little bit of revitalization.”

Keenan also stressed that climate haven cities need to help their own residents, which in turn will attract more climate migrants.

“This isn’t we’re going to build a community for tomorrow,” he said. “We’re going to build a community for today. And that’s going to be the foundation for the building of a community for tomorrow.”

Correction: Anna Marandi at the National League of Cities added two other places to the climate haven list: Ann Arbor, Michigan, and perhaps surprisingly, Orlando, Florida. An earlier version misstated the cities.

8U6QQg4OSLs,The Sun and Climate Change (Guest: Dr. Willie Soon) — The Climate Realism Show #151,"The scientific community and the media are focused almost exclusively by how greenhouse gas emissions affect the climate — from power plants to automobiles to your fireplace to your gas stove, and even cow farts. But what about that big ball of gas in the sky? Why does it get short shrift when it comes to the causes of climate change?

The Heartland Institute’s Anthony Watts, Linnea Lueken, Jim Lakely will discuss this topic, asked for by many of the show’s fans, with one of the leading solar and climate experts in the world: Dr. Willie Soon. We will also cover some of the Crazy Climate News of the Week, including a global warming conference that got snowed in, how climate change is affecting your naps, a promise by the crazies in Just Stop Oil to cease all its childish “direct action” to save the planet, and a debunking of human-caused climate change causing cherry blossoms to bloom too early.

y1GQxI3xotc,"It’s not too late: Climate action for women, by women","We have one planet, one chance to save it – and women and girls are leading the charge.
 
Women and girls are disproportionately vulnerable to the growing impacts of climate change, yet they are also critical advocates, innovators and decision-makers at the forefront of global climate action and solutions. This International Women’s Day (8 March 2022), under the theme “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow,” UN Women recognises and celebrates the contributions of women and girls around the world to build a more sustainable and equal future for all. By championing climate action by women, for women, we can ensure that it’s not too late.

HW4DnG-sUP0,Warming stripes: an emblem for climate action,"With 2021 looking set to be a big year for action on climate change, communicating the science and sparking conversations is more important than ever. The ‘warming stripes’ created by Professor Ed Hawkins do just this in a striking yet simple way. 

In this video, created by the University of Reading for the launch of the Green Horizon Perspectives 2021 series event hosted by City of London Corporation and Green Finance Institute (and supported by the World Economic Forum), Ed explains how the stripes have gained worldwide recognition, being shared by millions, from US senators to rock bands, appearing at international climate change events, and even popping up on a Tesla. The stripes speak to everyone, regardless of language and background, making them an ideal emblem for climate action as world leaders meet to discuss commitments to attempt to meet the Paris Agreement targets.

JhMCCgVz-Q8,Net zero by 2060: China’s bold new carbon emissions goal,"It had been hoped that 2020 would be the year the world got to grips with tackling the climate crisis.
But the coronavirus pandemic has delayed anticipated global negotiations.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday renewed his support for the Paris climate accord and called for a green focus as the world recovers from the COVID-19 crisis.
Xi announced that his country would effectively balance out its carbon emissions with measures to offset them before 2060. It is the first time the world’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide has pledged to end its net contribution to climate change.
On Thursday, world leaders will try to get the talks back on track, against a backdrop of increased wildfires, floods and hurricanes, and disappearing polar ice.

cl4Uv9_7KJE,Fleeing climate change — the real environmental disaster | DW Documentary,"How many millions of people will be forced to leave their homes by 2050? This documentary looks at the so-called hotspots of climate change in the Sahel zone, Indonesia and the Russian Tundra.

Lake Chad in the Sahel zone has already shrunk by 90 percent since the 1960s due to the increasing heat. About 40 million people will be forced to migrate to places where there is enough rainfall. Migration has always existed as a strategy to adapt to a changing environment. But the number of those forced to migrate solely because of climate change has increased dramatically since the 1990s. It is a double injustice: after becoming rich at the expense of the rest of the world, the industrialized countries are now polluting the atmosphere with their emissions and bringing a second misfortune to the inhabitants of the poorer regions. One of them is Mohammed Ibrahim: as Lake Chad got hotter and drier, he decided to go where the temperatures were less extreme and there was still a little water, trekking with his wife, children and 70 camels from Niger to Chad and then further south. The journey lasted several years and many members of his herd died of thirst. Now he and his family are living in a refugee camp: they only have seven camels left. Mohammed is one of many who have left their homelands in the Sahel - not because of conflict and crises, but because of the high temperatures. He's a real climate refugee.

VvwokJl_6j0,California is Burning And Global Warming Is To Blame. But We Disagree!,"What's really causing Wildfires in California?
Los Angeles is burning again. All of Southern California is facing a series of devastating wildfires, fueled by a combination of extreme weather conditions and controversial land management practices.

As of today (January 11th), five different fires have burned a total area of over 140 square kilometers, twice the size of Manhattan, destroying up to 10,000 buildings, causing 13 lifes, leaving as many missing, and necessitating the evacuation of at least 180,000 people. All this is happening in a winter month, which traditionally does not coincide with the wildfire season, much more common from July to October in California.

The fires are not yet under control, but the damage is already disastrous. Estimated damages are already around $150 billion.

Local authorities and experts agree that these events are a symptom of a larger problem: climate change and the need to adapt environmental policies.

We acknowledge this, but we believe things are not quite as they seem, and we'll explain why in the second part of this exciting video.

Wrg9rgsC9FM,"Up Close and Personal: Katie Patrick on Gamification, Climate Action, and Creative Learning (Epis...","Summary






In this dynamic episode of Resilience Gone Wild, host Jessica Morgenthal sits down with environmental engineer, designer, and author Katie Patrick to discuss a groundbreaking approach to environmental education—one that goes beyond awareness and centers on action design. Katie shares her journey from Australia to Silicon Valley and reveals how her experiences shaped the development of tools like the Earth Doctors curriculum and the School of Climate Action Design. These programs aim to inspire sustainable behavior change through gamification, creative expression, and hands-on learning, especially for children.






The conversation emphasizes the psychological underpinnings of environmental behavior change, the importance of data-driven design, and the power of storytelling, small group collaboration, and maker spaces in creating lasting impact. Katie and Jessica explore how reframing education into action unlocks greater community engagement and builds long-term resilience. Whether you’re a parent, educator, climate communicator, or just someone looking to make a difference, this episode is packed with insights for anyone passionate about sustainability and systems-level change.

Why the world urgently needs to expand its use of carbon prices: https://econ.st/2ZJdtmu 

Humans’ dependence on fossil fuels is heating up the planet at an unprecedented rate. Governments and policymakers must take urgent action. That action is guided by what science says about the impact of climate change on the Earth.

This is how it’s calculated.

This is Vilhelm Bjerknes. At the end of the 19th century he devised formulas which linked the flow of heat, water and air. 50 years later his ideas were the basis of the first computer model of the atmosphere. And modern-day weather forecasting was born

Today’s climate models are the highly evolved descendants of that original, except the computers are some 25trn times faster. Here’s how it works

Scientists divide the Earth’s atmosphere into a grid of hundreds of thousands of cells, in stacks like a skyscraper. 
The model used by the Met Office, Britain’s national weather service for example, uses stacks which are 85 cells high

The models then calculate how energy, air and water vapour flow through each cell over a given time period. While weather forecasting takes a snapshot of the atmosphere at a given time and predicts what will happen over the next few days

Climate models consider the atmosphere’s behaviour over years and years simulating either the world as it is or the world as it might be. 

For all their complexity, these models have limitations.

This means the models often struggle to capture details like cloud cover.

And clouds play a key role in climate. 

As greenhouse gases make the atmosphere warmer they change the amount of water vapour it can hold and how air rises and falls. That in turn changes the amount and character of cloud cover. Depending on where clouds form, they can either trap sunlight which warms the planet, or reflect it back into space, cooling it. And some processes which govern cloud formation work on a very small scale. 

Dozens of these models exist, run by teams all over the world

Every few years the models are brought together fed standardised questions and then their results are compared.

This helps scientists understand the strengths and weaknesses of different climate models, and improves them. Of course, it’s impossible to assess the models’ future projections.

But what researchers can do is compare the success of models from previous decades. A recent report compared the models from the 1970s to the 2000s.

The climate models are getting increasingly complicated capturing more aspects of the Earth.

But there is one element that is impossible to model. And it is the biggest contributor to climate change.

Instead, scientists take simplified results from these climate models and run them through economic models.

In 2013 scientists used these models to examine the effect of different climate policies on the future temperature of the planet. 

The first looked at what would happen if there was continued large-scale use of coal. The second, if there was continued use of fossil fuels but some use of renewable energy. The third, if there was a much higher uptake of renewable energy. And the fourth if there was a lot of use of carbon-capture technology and more land to grow biofuels.

Climate models don’t predict the future and they’re not perfect. There is a long way to go before they fully represent all of Earth’s intricate processes. But for now they are the only way that scientists have of understanding how damaging an increase in carbon dioxide will be for the planet. 
Ultimately, the solution to climate change won’t lie inside models but rather what humans choose to do with the information they provide",2020-05-29T16:00:42Z,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,The Economist,"['The Economist', 'Economist', 'Economist Films', 'Economist Videos', 'Politics', 'News', 'short-documentary', 'how scientists calculate climate change', 'science of climate change', 'climate change', 'global warming', 'climate', 'climate science', 'science', 'global climate change', 'misconceptions about climate change', 'global warming 101', 'science explained', 'global warming short film', 'climate crisis', 'climate change short film']",111812,2292,348,PT7M20S,25,none,3500000,963,360635827

The escalating crisis in Ukraine deserve the world’s focus right now, former US Secretary of State John Kerry told Ian Bremmer at the Munich Security Conference. “But the key is to remember here that Ukraine, one way or another, we’re going to resolve it ultimately over X number of years,” he said. “But the climate crisis remains existential, just as it was before the Ukraine crisis came up.” 

Kerry, who now serves as President Joe Biden’s Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, also warned that the biggest concern for Russia’s economy right now is not it’s expensive military operation in Ukraine, but rather the country’s melting permafrost, crumbling urban infrastructure, and how they extract their natural gas. “Russia has a profound climate problem,” Kerry added.

NxgCU8lErPQ,2024: A Year In Climate Change,"2024: a year of shambolic international negotiations, and terrible headlines (with positive caveats). Maximise your charitable end-of-year giving at https://givewell.org and use code simonclark to get your donation matched.

The past 12 months have been extremely eventful in the climate space. For the first time ever, the world is over 1.5C warmer than preindustrial times (though this won't last), emissions have climbed ever higher, and international negotiations perhaps reached their apex of ineffectiveness. But among all these negative headlines there are causes for optimism. Not enough to make the year anything other than a disaster, but enough to hold onto.

rN48_LnZbew,Arctic Warming Is Out of Control. But Can We Fix It?,"Arctic sea ice is melting at record levels throwing global weather into chaos and contributing to extreme warming. There are three MAJOR climate systems that may be approaching their tipping points, and their future depends, in part, on the existence of Arctic sea ice. But, the Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, and summer sea ice could disappear within our lifetimes. So, scientists and engineers are scrambling to figure out a way to slow the loss of sea ice. Can they do it in time? What will it cost? And, should we be studying it at all? Stay tuned as we explore a promising new technology that has high hopes of cooling the Arctic, just when we need it the most.

hx4NUqR5pBc,"UN: Climate Action Needed Amid Deadly Floods, Heat Waves in Europe","Climate action needs to be stepped up in light of devastating flooding in Germany and Belgium, as well as a persistent heatwave in Scandinavia, a World Meteorological Organization spokesperson insisted Friday.

Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, Clare Nullis said that while Europe was prepared ""on the whole,"" it was difficult to cope with extreme events such as the recent ""two months' worth of rainfall in two days.""

Flash flooding in Germany and Belgium has killed at least 120 people in the past week.

Many climate scientists have said the link to global warming is unmistakable.

""We need to step up the level of ambition; we're not doing nearly enough to stay within the targets of the Paris Agreement and keep temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius,"" said Nullis.

Nullis also said there had been unusually warm weather in parts of Scandinavia.

Kouvola Anjala, in southern Finland, had seen temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) for 27 consecutive days, she said.

""This is Finland, you know, it's not Spain, it's not North Africa,"" Nullis remarked.

The weather conditions come as the European Union prepares drastic plans costing billions of euros to contain climate change.

We dive deep into the concept of climate change, focusing on global warming and its devastating impacts. Carbon dioxide levels have surged to 419 million parts per million, leading to extreme weather conditions and the looming threat of runaway climate change. We discuss the primary culprits behind global warming, the role of capitalism in worsening the crisis, and why renewable energy isn't proving effective. The episode also highlights the staggering 41.6 billion tonnes of global carbon emissions and how 2024 has been recorded as the hottest year on record, with events like Log Angeles’ wildfires putting the environment at risk.

z1MypL_xQYU,How can workers get a ‘just transition’ amid the climate crisis? | The Stream,"Labour unions worldwide have for decades been on the frontline of efforts to restore, protect and improve worker rights. But as the global climate crisis intensifies, they are demanding a worker-friendly green future.

Environmental organisations have for years lobbied governments to swiftly move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and now a growing number of labour movements is pushing for a ‘just transition’ where workers have a voice. The International Labour Organization will also discuss ways to achieve such a transition during its annual conference starting June 5.

In a recent sign of how labour organisations are prioritising climate change, the Canadian Labour Congress’ annual convention heard from climate-focused union representatives who warned of the impact of wildfires and floods on working people. The union later pledged support for clean energy and green industrial policies that will guarantee workers dependable union jobs.

Labour unions are also allying with environmental groups to call the public’s attention to the climate emergency. In April, labour unions joined the Big One, a mass demonstration in London led by Extinction Rebellion. 

But some unions are nonetheless wary about what the future holds for working people amid the transition to low-carbon energy sources. South Africa’s National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) is among those who have expressed concerns that a recent energy transition investment deal between the country’s government and several western nations will see increased privatisation of the energy sector and endanger jobs. The union is calling for a renewable energy sector under public ownership.

In this episode of The Stream, we’ll look at how labour unions are fighting for workers amid the climate crisis and ask what’s needed to achieve a truly just transition from fossil fuels.

Wine production is a very sensitive process. Even the smallest changes in the climate or soil conditions of the grapes may alter the final product. In regards to the climate crisis, shifts in climate, weather patterns, and carbon dioxide levels can have a great impact on how wine tastes. In fact, it is possible that by the year 2100, the U.S. could lose up to 81% of its premium wine grape acreage. But even earlier, popular wine-producing countries like Italy, Greece, and France, could become completely inhospitable to grape production by 2050.

There are some technical solutions vineyards can do, like improving soil, water efficiency, moving planting to higher altitudes, and even changing the kind of grapes used for wine that’ll survive climate shocks. But the most important solution is climate action and mitigation of emissions.

In the paper, Hansen discusses how the recent IMO regulations on ship emissions were a significant contributor to the recent acceleration in global warming.  The paper more broadly shows that aerosols are a significant factor in climate change and their impact is underestimated by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

While not a co-author, Leon got a special acknowledgment in the paper: ""Leon Simons, Executive Director, climate researcher, and communicator at the Club of Rome Netherlands, deserves special acknowledgment. Leon informed us about restrictions on aerosol emissions imposed by the International Maritime Organization that led to our present study of global warming acceleration. He has continued to provide information that will aid more complete use of the inadvertent ship aerosol experiment to improve understanding of climate change and actions needed to stabilize climate.""

Leon Simons is a climate scientist based in the Netherlands. He was a co-author with James Hansen on the 2023 ""Global Warming in the Pipeline"" paper that discussed the recent acceleration in global warming.
